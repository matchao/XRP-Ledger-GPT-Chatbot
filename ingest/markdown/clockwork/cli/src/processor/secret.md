The `secret.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and provides functionality for managing secrets. It contains five public functions: `get`, `list`, `create`, `approve`, and `revoke`. These functions interact with the Clockwork relayer API to perform various operations on secrets.

1. `get`: This function retrieves a secret by its name. It takes a `Client` and a `String` (name) as input and returns a `Result`. It creates a `SecretGet` message, serializes it, signs it with the client's keypair, and sends a POST request to the `/secret_get` endpoint. If successful, it prints the plaintext response.

2. `list`: This function lists all secrets associated with the client. It takes a `Client` as input and returns a `Result`. It creates a `SecretList` message, serializes it, signs it with the client's keypair, and sends a POST request to the `/secret_list` endpoint. If successful, it prints the plaintext response.

3. `create`: This function creates a new secret with a given name and word. It takes a `Client` and two `String`s (name and word) as input and returns a `Result`. It creates a `SecretCreate` message, serializes it, signs it with the client's keypair, and sends a POST request to the `/secret_create` endpoint.

4. `approve`: This function approves a delegate to access a secret by its name. It takes a `Client`, a `String` (name), and a `Pubkey` (delegate) as input and returns a `Result`. It creates a `SecretApprove` message, serializes it, signs it with the client's keypair, and sends a POST request to the `/secret_approve` endpoint.

5. `revoke`: This function revokes a delegate's access to a secret by its name. It takes a `Client`, a `String` (name), and a `Pubkey` (delegate) as input and returns a `Result`. It creates a `SecretRevoke` message, serializes it, signs it with the client's keypair, and sends a POST request to the `/secret_revoke` endpoint.

All functions use the `SignedRequest` struct to send signed messages to the API. They also use the `reqwest` library for making HTTP requests and the `bincode` library for serialization. The functions return a `CliError` in case of any errors.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `SignedRequest` struct and its fields?
   Answer: The `SignedRequest` struct is used to create a request object containing the message (`msg`), the signer's public key (`signer`), and the signature of the message (`signature`). This is used to authenticate the request and ensure the message has not been tampered with.

2. Question: What is the role of the `bincode::serialize` function and why is it used in this code?
   Answer: The `bincode::serialize` function is used to convert the message object into a binary format. This is done to create a byte representation of the message, which is then signed by the keypair to generate the signature.

3. Question: Why is the `reqwest::blocking::Client` used instead of the asynchronous version of the reqwest client?
   Answer: The `reqwest::blocking::Client` is used because the functions in this code are synchronous and return a `Result` type. Using the blocking client ensures that the HTTP requests are executed synchronously, matching the function signatures.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `if let Ok(plaintext) = res` block in the `get` and `list` functions?
   Answer: The `if let Ok(plaintext) = res` block is used to check if the HTTP request was successful (i.e., the response is `Ok`). If the request is successful, the response's plaintext is printed to the console. If the request is not successful, the block is skipped, and the function returns `Ok(())`.

5. Question: What are the responsibilities of the `create`, `approve`, and `revoke` functions, and how do they differ from each other?
   Answer: The `create` function is responsible for creating a new secret with a given name and word. The `approve` function is used to grant access to a secret to a specified delegate by providing their public key. The `revoke` function is used to revoke access to a secret from a specified delegate. The main difference between these functions is the message type they use (`SecretCreate`, `SecretApprove`, and `SecretRevoke`) and the corresponding API endpoints they call.
