The `config.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for managing the configuration settings of the Clockwork network. It contains two public functions: `get` and `set`. The file imports necessary modules and structs from the `clockwork_client` crate and the `solana_sdk` crate, as well as the `CliError` from the `errors` module within the same project.

1. `get` function:
   - Input: A reference to a `Client` object.
   - Output: A `Result` with an empty tuple or a `CliError`.
   - Purpose: This function retrieves the current configuration settings from the Clockwork network using the `client.get()` method. If the configuration is not found, it returns a `CliError::AccountNotFound` error with the public key of the configuration account. If successful, it prints the configuration settings and returns an empty tuple wrapped in a `Result`.

2. `set` function:
   - Input: A reference to a `Client` object, and optional `Pubkey` values for `admin`, `epoch_thread`, and `hasher_thread`.
   - Output: A `Result` with an empty tuple or a `CliError`.
   - Purpose: This function updates the configuration settings of the Clockwork network. It first retrieves the current configuration using the `client.get()` method, similar to the `get` function. If the configuration is not found, it returns a `CliError::AccountNotFound` error. Then, it builds a new `ConfigSettings` struct with the provided values or the current values if the input is `None`. It creates a new transaction instruction (`ix`) using the `config_update` function from the `clockwork_client::network::instruction` module, and submits the transaction using the `client.send_and_confirm()` method. If successful, it calls the `get` function to display the updated configuration settings and returns an empty tuple wrapped in a `Result`.

In summary, the `config.rs` file provides functionality to manage the configuration settings of the Clockwork network, allowing developers to retrieve and update the settings using the `get` and `set` functions.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `get` function?
   Answer: The `get` function retrieves the current configuration from the client and prints it. It returns a `Result` type with an empty tuple or a `CliError` if the account is not found.

2. Question: How does the `set` function update the configuration?
   Answer: The `set` function first retrieves the current configuration, then builds a new `ConfigSettings` struct with the provided values (or keeps the existing ones if not provided), and finally submits a transaction to update the configuration on the network.

3. Question: What are the input parameters for the `set` function?
   Answer: The `set` function takes a reference to a `Client`, and three optional `Pubkey` parameters: `admin`, `epoch_thread`, and `hasher_thread`.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `ConfigSettings` struct?
   Answer: The `ConfigSettings` struct is used to store the configuration settings for the clockwork network, including the admin, epoch thread, hasher thread, and mint.

5. Question: What happens if an error occurs while updating the configuration in the `set` function?
   Answer: If an error occurs while updating the configuration, the `set` function will return a `CliError` with the appropriate error message. The error handling is done using the `map_err` function and the `?` operator.
