The `config.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for defining and managing the configuration settings for the command-line interface (CLI). It imports necessary modules and constants, defines a `CliConfig` struct, and provides a method to load the configuration from a file.

The file starts by importing the `Duration` struct from the `std::time` module and the `CommitmentConfig` struct from the `solana_sdk::commitment_config` module. It then defines two constants for default timeout durations: `DEFAULT_RPC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_TX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, which are set to 30 seconds and 5 seconds, respectively.

The `CliConfig` struct is defined with the following fields:
- `json_rpc_url`: A string representing the JSON-RPC URL.
- `websocket_url`: A string representing the WebSocket URL.
- `relayer_url`: A string representing the relayer URL.
- `keypair_path`: A string representing the path to the keypair file.
- `rpc_timeout`: A `Duration` representing the RPC timeout.
- `commitment`: A `CommitmentConfig` representing the commitment configuration.
- `confirm_transaction_initial_timeout`: A `Duration` representing the initial timeout for confirming transactions.

The `impl CliConfig` block provides a `load()` method that returns an instance of the `CliConfig` struct. This method reads the Solana configuration file using the `solana_cli_config::Config::load()` function and initializes a new `CliConfig` instance with the values from the Solana configuration. The `relayer_url` field is currently hardcoded to "127.0.0.1:8000" and should be updated to read from the Clockwork configuration file in the future.

In summary, the `config.rs` file is responsible for defining the CLI configuration settings for the Clockwork project and provides a method to load these settings from a configuration file. It is essential for developers working on the project to understand the structure and usage of this file to properly configure and interact with the Clockwork CLI.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `CliConfig` struct?
   Answer: The `CliConfig` struct is used to store configuration settings for the Clockwork project, including URLs for JSON-RPC, WebSocket, and relayer, as well as keypair path, RPC timeout, commitment configuration, and transaction confirmation timeout.

2. Question: How are the default values for `DEFAULT_RPC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_TX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` determined?
   Answer: The default values for `DEFAULT_RPC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_TX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` are set to 30 seconds and 5 seconds, respectively, using the `Duration::from_secs()` function. The rationale behind these specific values is not provided in the code.

3. Question: How does the `load()` function work in the `CliConfig` implementation?
   Answer: The `load()` function reads the Solana configuration file, extracts the necessary values (JSON-RPC URL, WebSocket URL, keypair path), and initializes a new `CliConfig` instance with these values, along with default values for RPC timeout, commitment configuration, and transaction confirmation timeout.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `CommitmentConfig` type in the `CliConfig` struct?
   Answer: The `CommitmentConfig` type is used to specify the commitment level for queries and transactions in the Solana network. In this code, it is set to `CommitmentConfig::confirmed()`, which means that the commitment level is set to "confirmed" for the Clockwork project.

5. Question: How is the `relayer_url` field in the `CliConfig` struct initialized, and is there a plan to change this in the future?
   Answer: The `relayer_url` field is currently initialized with a hardcoded value "127.0.0.1:8000". There is a comment in the code indicating a plan to read this value from the Clockwork configuration file in the future, instead of using a hardcoded value.
