The `webhook.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for executing webhooks. It defines a struct called `WebhookExecutor` and its associated methods. The primary function of this file is to send HTTP requests to specified URLs when certain events occur in the system.

The `WebhookExecutor` struct has a single field, `config`, which is of type `PluginConfig`. This field stores the configuration settings for the plugin.

The `new` function is an associated function that creates a new instance of the `WebhookExecutor` struct. It takes a `PluginConfig` as an argument and returns a new `WebhookExecutor` with the given configuration.

The `execute_webhooks` function is an asynchronous method that takes a reference-counted `Arc<Self>`, an `Arc<RpcClient>`, and a vector of `Pubkey` as arguments. It returns a `PluginResult<()>`. This function is responsible for executing the webhooks by sending HTTP requests to the specified URLs. It iterates through the given `pubkeys` and retrieves the corresponding `Webhook` objects from the `client`. It then sends an HTTP POST request to the hardcoded URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/relay" with a JSON payload containing the `Relay` object, which includes the `webhook_pubkey`. The function logs the webhook response or any errors that occur during the request.

The `Debug` trait is implemented for the `WebhookExecutor` struct, which provides a custom implementation of the `fmt` function. This function takes a mutable reference to a `std::fmt::Formatter` and returns a `std::fmt::Result`. It writes a simple string "webhook-executor" to the formatter.

Note that there is a commented-out section of code in the `execute_webhooks` function, which appears to be an alternative implementation using a different approach for sending HTTP requests. This code may be a work in progress or a placeholder for future improvements.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `WebhookExecutor` struct and its associated methods?
   Answer: The `WebhookExecutor` struct is responsible for executing webhooks with the given configuration. It has a method `execute_webhooks` that takes a list of pubkeys and sends a request to the specified URL for each webhook.

2. Question: Why is the `execute_webhooks` method using an `Arc<Self>` and an `Arc<RpcClient>`?
   Answer: The `Arc<Self>` and `Arc<RpcClient>` are used to allow shared ownership of the `WebhookExecutor` and `RpcClient` instances, enabling multiple tasks to access them concurrently without the need for explicit synchronization.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the commented-out code in the `execute_webhooks` method?
   Answer: The commented-out code seems to be an alternative implementation for sending webhook requests, which includes additional headers and error handling. It might be a work-in-progress or a previous implementation that was replaced by the current one.

4. Question: Why is the `url` hardcoded to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/relay" in the `execute_webhooks` method?
   Answer: The hardcoded URL is likely a placeholder or a default value for testing purposes. In a production environment, the URL should be configurable or derived from the webhook data.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `Debug` trait implementation for `WebhookExecutor`?
   Answer: The `Debug` trait implementation for `WebhookExecutor` allows it to be formatted using the `{:?}` format specifier, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes. In this case, it simply outputs "webhook-executor" when formatted.
