The `navbar.rs` file is part of a project called Clockwork and contains the code for rendering the navigation bar of the application. It uses the Dioxus framework for building user interfaces and the Dioxus Router for handling navigation.

The file consists of three main functions: `Navbar`, `Logo`, and `Balance`.

1. `Navbar` function:
   This function is responsible for rendering the main navigation bar. It creates a `div` element with specific CSS classes for styling and layout. Inside this `div`, it renders the `Logo` and another `div` containing the `Balance` and `ConnectButton` components. The `ConnectButton` component is imported from the `components` module.

2. `Logo` function:
   This function renders the logo of the application. It uses the `Link` component from the Dioxus Router to create a navigational link to the root path ("/"). The logo image is included using an `img` element with the source set to "/img/CLOCKWORK.svg".

3. `Balance` function:
   This function is responsible for displaying the user's balance. It first retrieves the `User` context using the `use_shared_state` hook. If the user has an account, it formats the balance using the `format_balance` utility function and displays it in a `div` element with a specific CSS class for styling. If the user does not have an account, an empty string is displayed.

In summary, the `navbar.rs` file defines the structure and functionality of the navigation bar for the Clockwork project. It includes the application logo, user balance, and a connect button. The file utilizes the Dioxus framework for UI rendering and the Dioxus Router for navigation.
