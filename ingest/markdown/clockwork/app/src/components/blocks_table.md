The `blocks_table.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for displaying a table of recent blocks and their associated information. It uses the Dioxus library for creating user interfaces, the Solana Client Wasm library for interacting with the Solana blockchain, and the dotenv_codegen library for accessing environment variables.

The main function in this file is `BlocksTable`, which returns an `Element` representing the table of blocks. It uses the `use_state` hook to manage the state of the most recent block, initially set to `None`. The `use_future` hook is used to asynchronously fetch the latest block and update the state every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the `get_block` function.

The `get_block` function is an asynchronous function that fetches the latest block from the Solana blockchain using the Helius API. It constructs the API URL using the `HELIUS_API_KEY` environment variable, creates a `WasmClient` instance, and fetches the latest blockhash with the `CommitmentConfig::processed()` commitment level. It then fetches the block details, including transaction signatures and rewards, using the `get_block_with_config` method.

The `BlocksTable` function renders the table using the Dioxus `rsx!` macro, which allows for JSX-like syntax. The table header is created using the `Header` function, which returns an `Element` representing the header row with columns for "Blockhash" and "Transactions". The table body is populated with the block information stored in the `block` state. If a block is available, a table row (`tr`) is created with two table cells (`td`), displaying the blockhash and the number of transactions in the block.

In summary, the `blocks_table.rs` file is responsible for fetching and displaying a table of recent blocks from the Solana blockchain using the Helius API. It uses Dioxus for rendering the user interface and Solana Client Wasm for interacting with the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `BlocksTable` function?
   Answer: The `BlocksTable` function is responsible for rendering a table that displays information about the most recent block, such as the blockhash and the number of transactions in the block.

2. Question: How does the code handle updating the block information?
   Answer: The code uses a `use_future` hook with an async loop that continuously fetches the latest block using the `get_block` function and updates the `block` state with the new block information every 1000 milliseconds.

3. Question: What is the role of the `Header` function?
   Answer: The `Header` function is responsible for rendering the header row of the table, which contains the column titles "Blockhash" and "Transactions".

4. Question: How does the `get_block` function fetch the latest block information?
   Answer: The `get_block` function uses the `WasmClient` to connect to the Helius API, fetches the latest blockhash with the `get_latest_blockhash_with_commitment` method, and then retrieves the block details using the `get_block_with_config` method.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `HELIUS_API_KEY` constant in the `get_block` function?
   Answer: The `HELIUS_API_KEY` constant is used to store the API key required to access the Helius API, which is fetched from the environment using the `dotenv!` macro. This API key is then used to construct the URL for the Helius RPC endpoint.
