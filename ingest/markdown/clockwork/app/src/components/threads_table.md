The `threads_table.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for rendering a table that displays information about threads. It uses the Dioxus framework for creating user interfaces and the Clockwork SDK for fetching thread data.

The main function in this file is `ThreadsTable(cx: Scope) -> Element`, which takes a `Scope` as input and returns an `Element`. This function initializes a state variable `threads` to store a vector of tuples containing `Thread` and `Account` objects. It then uses the `use_future` hook to fetch threads asynchronously using the `get_threads()` function from the Clockwork SDK and updates the `threads` state variable.

The `ThreadsTable` function checks if the `threads` state variable has any data. If it does, it renders a table with a header and a row for each thread using the `Header` and `Row` functions. If there is no data, it renders a "Loading..." message.

The `Header(cx: Scope) -> Element` function renders the table header with column names such as "Thread", "Balance", "Created at", "ID", "Paused", and "Trigger".

The `Row(cx: Scope<RowProps>) -> Element` function takes a `Scope` with `RowProps` and returns an `Element`. The `RowProps` struct contains a `Thread`, an `Account`, and an `elem_id` string. This function extracts relevant information from the `Thread` and `Account` objects, such as the thread's public key, balance, creation timestamp, ID, paused status, and trigger type. It then renders a table row with this information using the `Link` component from the Dioxus Router, which allows users to navigate to the thread details page when clicking on a row.

In summary, the `threads_table.rs` file is responsible for fetching and displaying a table of threads with relevant information, such as public key, balance, creation timestamp, ID, paused status, and trigger type. It uses the Dioxus framework for rendering the user interface and the Clockwork SDK for fetching thread data.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `ThreadsTable` function?
   Answer: The `ThreadsTable` function is responsible for rendering a table that displays information about threads, such as thread pubkey, balance, creation time, ID, paused status, and trigger type.

2. Question: How does the code handle the case when there are no threads to display?
   Answer: If there are no threads to display (i.e., `threads.get().len() == 0`), the code renders a `div` element with the text "Loading..." to indicate that the data is being fetched.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `Header` function?
   Answer: The `Header` function is responsible for rendering the header row of the threads table, which contains column titles such as "Thread", "Balance", "Created at", "ID", "Paused", and "Trigger".

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `RowProps` struct?
   Answer: The `RowProps` struct is used to define the properties required for rendering a single row in the threads table, which includes the thread data, account data, and an element ID.

5. Question: How does the `Row` function render the trigger type for a thread?
   Answer: The `Row` function uses a match expression to determine the trigger type based on the `thread.trigger` value. It then assigns a string representation of the trigger type ("Account", "Cron", or "Immediate") to the `trigger` variable, which is displayed in the table cell.
