The `markets_table.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for rendering a table displaying market data. It uses the Dioxus library for creating user interfaces and the Pyth library for fetching market data.

The main function in this file is `MarketsTable(cx: Scope) -> Element`, which creates a table element with market data. It initializes a state variable `market_data` with an empty vector. The `use_future` function is used to fetch market data asynchronously and update the `market_data` state variable every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the `get_price_feeds()` function from the Pyth library.

The `MarketsTable` function renders a `div` element containing a title "Markets" and a table with market data. The table is created using the `Header` function for the table header and a loop that iterates through the `market_data` state variable to create table rows using the `Row` function.

The `Header(cx: Scope) -> Element` function renders the table header with two columns: "Ticker" and "Price". It uses the `thead`, `tr`, and `th` elements to create the header structure.

The `Row` function takes a `RowProps` struct as a property, which contains an `elem_id` string and a `price` object of type `PythFeedPrice`. The `Row` function renders a table row (`tr`) with two cells (`td`): one for the ticker and one for the price. The price is formatted using the `quote()` method from the `Quotable` trait implemented by the `PythFeedPrice` type.

In summary, the `markets_table.rs` file is responsible for rendering a table with market data fetched from the Pyth library. It uses Dioxus for creating the user interface and updates the market data every second.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `MarketsTable` function?
   Answer: The `MarketsTable` function is responsible for rendering a table of market data, which includes fetching the price feeds, updating the state, and rendering the table with the header and rows containing the ticker and price information.

2. Question: How does the `use_future` function work in this code?
   Answer: The `use_future` function is used to fetch the price feeds asynchronously and update the `market_data` state in a loop with a 1-second interval. It takes a closure that returns an async block, which is executed in the background.

3. Question: What is the role of the `Header` function?
   Answer: The `Header` function is responsible for rendering the table header, which includes the column names "Ticker" and "Price" with appropriate styling.

4. Question: How are the row elements created in the `MarketsTable` function?
   Answer: The row elements are created using a for loop that iterates over the `market_data` state. For each item in the state, a `Row` component is created with the `elem_id` and `price` properties set to the current index and feed data, respectively.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `Row` function and the `RowProps` struct?
   Answer: The `Row` function is responsible for rendering a single row in the table with the ticker and price information. The `RowProps` struct defines the properties required for the `Row` component, which includes the `elem_id` and `price` data.
