The `hot_keys.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for handling keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) within the application. It uses the Dioxus framework for building reactive web applications, the Dioxus Router for navigation, Gloo Events for event handling, and Web Sys for interacting with the DOM.

The main function in this file is `HotKeys(cx: Scope) -> Element`, which takes a `Scope` as an input and returns an `Element`. The function initializes the router using `use_router(&cx)` and sets up an event listener for the "keydown" event on the document.

The event listener is an asynchronous closure that captures a clone of the router. It initializes two variables: `goto_mode`, a boolean flag that indicates whether the user is in "go-to" mode, and `list_index`, an optional `usize` that keeps track of the current list item index.

When a "keydown" event is triggered, the closure checks the pressed key and performs the corresponding action based on the key and the current state of `goto_mode`. The supported hotkeys are:

- "G" or "g": Toggles `goto_mode` on.
- "B" or "b": If `goto_mode` is on, navigates to the "/blocks" route and turns off `goto_mode`.
- "F" or "f": If `goto_mode` is on, navigates to the "/files" route and turns off `goto_mode`.
- "H" or "h": If `goto_mode` is on, navigates to the root ("/") route and turns off `goto_mode`.
- "P" or "p": If `goto_mode` is on, navigates to the "/programs" route and turns off `goto_mode`.
- "S" or "s": If `goto_mode` is on, navigates to the "/secrets" route and turns off `goto_mode`.
- "J" or "j": Turns off `goto_mode`, increments the `list_index`, and focuses the next list item with the ID "list-item-{id}".
- "K" or "k": Turns off `goto_mode`, decrements the `list_index`, and focuses the previous list item with the ID "list-item-{id}".

The function then returns an empty `div` element, as the main purpose of this component is to handle hotkeys and not to render any visible content.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `HotKeys` function?
   Answer: The `HotKeys` function is responsible for handling keyboard shortcuts in the application, allowing users to navigate to different routes and interact with a list using specific key combinations.

2. Question: How does the `goto_mode` variable work in this code?
   Answer: The `goto_mode` variable is a boolean flag that is set to true when the user presses the "G" or "g" key. It is used to determine if the user is in "goto mode" and should navigate to a specific route when pressing other keys.

3. Question: What are the different routes that can be navigated to using hotkeys in this code?
   Answer: The available routes that can be navigated to using hotkeys are "/blocks", "/files", "/programs", "/secrets", and the root route "/". These routes are navigated to by pressing the corresponding keys "B", "F", "P", "S", and "H" while in "goto mode".

4. Question: How does the code handle moving focus between list items using the "J" and "K" keys?
   Answer: When the "J" key is pressed, the code increments the `list_index` and tries to focus on the next list item with the ID "list-item-{id}". When the "K" key is pressed, the code decrements the `list_index` and tries to focus on the previous list item with the ID "list-item-{id}". If the focus is successful, the `list_index` is updated accordingly.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `use_future` function in this code?
   Answer: The `use_future` function is used to create an asynchronous event listener for the "keydown" event on the document. It allows the code to handle keyboard events asynchronously and perform actions like navigating to different routes or focusing on list items based on the pressed keys.
