The `files.rs` file is a part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for rendering the Files page. It uses the Dioxus library, which is a reactive UI library for Rust, to create and manage the user interface elements.

The file starts by importing the necessary modules and components. It imports the `prelude` module from the `dioxus` crate, which contains the essential types and traits required for working with Dioxus. It also imports the `Page` component from the parent module (indicated by `super::Page`), which is likely a reusable layout component for the project.

The main functionality of this file is provided by the `FilesPage` function. This function takes a `Scope` parameter, which is a Dioxus type that represents the context in which the component is being rendered. The `Scope` is used to manage the component's state and lifecycle.

Inside the `FilesPage` function, the `cx.render()` method is called with an `rsx!` block. RSX (Rust Syntax eXtension) is a macro that allows writing HTML-like syntax directly in Rust code. This makes it easier to define and manipulate UI elements in a familiar and readable way.

The `rsx!` block contains a `Page` component, which is likely a reusable layout component for the project. Inside the `Page` component, an `h1` element is defined with a class attribute set to `"text-2xl font-semibold"`. This class attribute likely comes from a CSS framework (such as Tailwind CSS) and is used to style the heading. The content of the `h1` element is set to the string `"Files"`.

In summary, the `files.rs` file is responsible for rendering the Files page in the Clockwork project. It uses the Dioxus library to create a reactive UI and leverages the RSX macro to define the UI elements in an HTML-like syntax. The main component of this file is the `FilesPage` function, which renders a `Page` component containing an `h1` element with the text "Files".
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `FilesPage` function?
   Answer: The `FilesPage` function is responsible for rendering the Files page with a specific layout and style, using the `Page` component and the `h1` element with a class and text content.

2. Question: What is the `dioxus::prelude::*` import used for?
   Answer: The `dioxus::prelude::*` import is used to bring commonly used items from the Dioxus library into scope, which is a UI framework for building web applications in Rust.

3. Question: What is the `Scope` type in the function signature of `FilesPage`?
   Answer: The `Scope` type is a part of the Dioxus framework and represents the context in which the component is being rendered, providing access to the component's state and lifecycle methods.

4. Question: What is the `rsx!` macro used for in the `FilesPage` function?
   Answer: The `rsx!` macro is a part of the Dioxus framework and is used to define the component's layout and style using a JSX-like syntax, making it easier to write and read the component's structure.

5. Question: How can the styling of the `h1` element be modified or extended?
   Answer: The styling of the `h1` element can be modified or extended by updating the `class` attribute value with additional CSS classes or by adding inline styles using the `style` attribute.
