The `new_secret.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for creating a new secret. It uses various libraries such as `anchor_lang`, `dioxus`, `dioxus_router`, `dotenv_codegen`, `reqwest`, and `solana_client_wasm` to achieve its functionality.

The main function in this file is `NewSecretPage(cx: Scope) -> Element`, which returns an `Element` representing the New Secret page. This function uses the `use_router` hook to access the router and `use_state` hooks to manage the state of the `name` and `word` variables. The function renders a form with two input fields for the user to enter the name and value of the new secret. There are two buttons, "Cancel" and "Continue", for navigation and submission, respectively.

When the "Continue" button is clicked, the `create_secret` function is called with the current values of `name` and `word`. This function is an asynchronous function that takes a `String` name and a `String` word as arguments and returns a `String`. It creates a `SecretCreate` object with the given name and word, serializes it into bytes, and signs the message using the `backpack` module. The signed request is then sent to the Clockwork relayer API using the `reqwest` library, with the endpoint `/secret_create` and the relayer URL specified in the environment variable `RELAYER_URL`.

In summary, the `new_secret.rs` file provides a user interface for creating a new secret and handles the process of signing and sending the secret creation request to the Clockwork relayer API.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `NewSecretPage` function?
   Answer: The `NewSecretPage` function is responsible for rendering the user interface for creating a new secret, including input fields for the secret's name and value, and buttons for canceling or continuing the process.

2. Question: How does the `create_secret` function work?
   Answer: The `create_secret` function takes a name and a word as input, creates a `SecretCreate` message, serializes it, signs it using the `backpack` module, and sends a signed request to the relayer API to create a new secret.

3. Question: What is the role of the `backpack` module in this code?
   Answer: The `backpack` module is used for signing the message containing the secret's name and value, and providing the public key of the signer.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `dotenv!("RELAYER_URL")` macro?
   Answer: The `dotenv!("RELAYER_URL")` macro is used to read the value of the `RELAYER_URL` environment variable, which is the URL of the relayer API that the `create_secret` function sends requests to.

5. Question: How are the input fields for the secret's name and value handled in the `NewSecretPage` function?
   Answer: The input fields for the secret's name and value are managed using the `use_state` hook, which creates a stateful value and a function to update it. The `oninput` event handler is used to update the state when the user types in the input fields.
