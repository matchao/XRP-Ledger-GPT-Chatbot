The `thread.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for rendering the Thread Page, which displays detailed information about a specific thread and its simulation logs. The file uses the Dioxus library for creating user interfaces and the Clockwork SDK for interacting with the Clockwork state.

The main function in this file is `ThreadPage`, which takes a `Scope` as input and returns an `Element`. It first retrieves the current route and initializes a state variable `thread` with an `Option<Thread>` type. It then uses the `use_future` hook to fetch the thread data asynchronously using the `get_thread` function from the Clockwork SDK, passing the thread's public key as an argument.

Once the thread data is fetched, the `ThreadPage` function renders the page using the `rsx!` macro. If the thread data is available, it renders a `Page` element containing a `ThreadInfoTable` and `SimulationLogs` components. Otherwise, it displays a "Loading..." message.

The `ThreadInfoTable` component takes a `Thread` as a prop and renders a table displaying various properties of the thread, such as its address, authority, creation time, fee, ID, paused status, and trigger. The `Row` component is used to render each row of the table.

The `SimulationLogs` component also takes a `Thread` as a prop and is responsible for rendering the simulation logs of the thread. It initializes two state variables, `logs` and `log_errors`, and uses the `use_future` hook to fetch the simulation logs asynchronously using the `simulate_thread` function from the Clockwork SDK. Once the logs are fetched, the component renders a `div` containing the logs in a `code` element.

The `next_timestamp` function is a utility function that calculates the next timestamp for a given schedule string and returns it as an `Option<i64>`.

Overall, this file is responsible for rendering the Thread Page, which displays detailed information about a specific thread and its simulation logs, using the Dioxus library and the Clockwork SDK.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `ThreadPage` function?
   Answer: The `ThreadPage` function is responsible for rendering the main thread page, which includes the thread information table and simulation logs.

2. Question: How is the thread data fetched and set in the `ThreadPage` function?
   Answer: The thread data is fetched using the `get_thread` function with the `thread_pubkey` as an argument. The fetched data is then set to the `thread` state using the `thread.set()` method.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `ThreadInfoTable` function?
   Answer: The `ThreadInfoTable` function is responsible for rendering a table that displays various information about a thread, such as its address, authority, creation time, fee, ID, paused status, and trigger.

4. Question: How are the simulation logs fetched and displayed in the `SimulationLogs` function?
   Answer: The simulation logs are fetched using the `simulate_thread` function with the `thread` as an argument. The fetched logs are then set to the `logs` state, and the logs are displayed within a `code` element using a loop.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `next_timestamp` function?
   Answer: The `next_timestamp` function calculates the next timestamp for a given schedule, taking into account the provided `after` timestamp. It returns an `Option<i64>` representing the next timestamp or `None` if there is no next timestamp.
