The `not_found.rs` file is a part of the Clockwork project and contains a single function called `NotFoundPage`. This file is responsible for rendering a "Not found" message when a requested page or resource is not available within the application. The code uses the Dioxus library, which is a reactive UI framework for Rust, to create and render the "Not found" message as an HTML element.

The code starts by importing the necessary components from the Dioxus library using the `use dioxus::prelude::*;` statement. This allows the code to access the Dioxus prelude module, which contains commonly used types and traits for building user interfaces.

The `NotFoundPage` function is defined with a single parameter, `cx`, which is of type `Scope`. The `Scope` type is provided by the Dioxus library and represents the context in which the UI component is being rendered. This context is used to manage the component's state and lifecycle.

Inside the `NotFoundPage` function, the `cx.render()` method is called with an `rsx!` macro. The `rsx!` macro is a custom syntax provided by the Dioxus library, which allows developers to write UI components using a JSX-like syntax. In this case, the `rsx!` macro is used to create an `h1` HTML element with the text "Not found".

The `cx.render()` method takes the created `h1` element and returns it as an `Element` type. The `Element` type is also provided by the Dioxus library and represents a generic UI element that can be rendered on the screen.

In summary, the `not_found.rs` file is responsible for rendering a "Not found" message when a requested page or resource is not available in the Clockwork project. It uses the Dioxus library to create and render the message as an HTML element. The `NotFoundPage` function takes a `Scope` parameter, which represents the rendering context, and returns the "Not found" message as an `Element` type.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `NotFoundPage` function?
   Answer: The `NotFoundPage` function is responsible for rendering a "Not found" message, likely when a requested page or resource is not available in the application.

2. Question: What is the `dioxus::prelude::*` import used for?
   Answer: The `dioxus::prelude::*` import brings in the necessary types and functions from the Dioxus library, which is a reactive UI framework for Rust.

3. Question: What is the `Scope` type in the function signature of `NotFoundPage`?
   Answer: The `Scope` type is a part of the Dioxus framework and represents the context in which the `NotFoundPage` function is being called, allowing access to the rendering context and other related functionality.

4. Question: What is the `rsx!` macro used for in the `NotFoundPage` function?
   Answer: The `rsx!` macro is a part of the Dioxus framework and allows for writing JSX-like syntax in Rust code, making it easier to define and render HTML elements.

5. Question: How can the `NotFoundPage` function be integrated into the larger Clockwork project?
   Answer: The `NotFoundPage` function can be used as a fallback or error page in the Clockwork project's routing system, displaying the "Not found" message when a requested page or resource is not available.
