The `secrets.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for handling the display and retrieval of secrets. It uses various libraries such as `anchor_lang`, `clockwork_relayer_api`, `dioxus`, `dioxus_router`, `dotenv_codegen`, `reqwest`, and `solana_client_wasm`. The main functionality is provided through the `SecretsPage` function, which returns an `Element` representing the secrets page.

The `SecretsPage` function takes a `Scope` as an argument and initializes a state variable `secrets` to store a vector of strings. It then uses the `use_future` function to asynchronously fetch secrets if the backpack is connected. The fetched secrets are then set to the `secrets` state variable.

The `SecretsPage` function renders a `Page` element containing a header with the title "Secrets" and a "New secret" link. If there are no secrets, it displays a message "No secrets". Otherwise, it renders a table with headers "Name", "Created at", and "Shared with", and iterates through the secrets to display them in table rows.

The `Header` function is a helper function that takes a `Scope` as an argument and returns an `Element` representing the table header. It sets the classes and attributes for the table header and its columns.

The `get_secrets` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves the secrets from the server. It creates a `SecretList` message and serializes it using `bincode`. It then creates a `SignedRequest` object with the message, signer's public key, and signature. The signature is generated using the `backpack.sign_message` function. The function sends a POST request to the `RELAYER_URL` with the `SignedRequest` object as JSON payload. If the request is successful, it returns the secrets from the `SecretListResponse`. If there's an error, it returns an empty vector.

In summary, the `secrets.rs` file is responsible for displaying and fetching secrets in the Clockwork project. It provides a `SecretsPage` function to render the secrets page, a `Header` function to render the table header, and a `get_secrets` function to fetch secrets from the server.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `SecretsPage` function?
   Answer: The `SecretsPage` function is responsible for rendering the secrets page, which displays a list of secrets, and provides a link to create a new secret.

2. Question: How does the `get_secrets` function fetch the secrets?
   Answer: The `get_secrets` function sends a signed request to the relayer API, which returns a list of secrets. It uses the `reqwest` library to make the HTTP request and `bincode` for serialization.

3. Question: What is the role of the `Header` function in the code?
   Answer: The `Header` function is responsible for rendering the header row of the secrets table, which includes the column names "Name", "Created at", and "Shared with".

4. Question: How is the state managed for the list of secrets in the `SecretsPage` function?
   Answer: The state for the list of secrets is managed using the `use_state` hook, which initializes an empty vector of strings. The state is updated with the fetched secrets using the `set` method.

5. Question: What libraries are being used in this code and what are their purposes?
   Answer: The code uses several libraries, including `anchor_lang` for working with the Solana blockchain, `clockwork_relayer_api` for interacting with the relayer API, `dioxus` for building the user interface, `dioxus_router` for handling routing, `dotenv_codegen` for accessing environment variables, `reqwest` for making HTTP requests, and `solana_client_wasm` for working with Solana signatures.
