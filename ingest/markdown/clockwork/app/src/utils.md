The `utils.rs` file is a utility module for the Clockwork project, providing two helper functions to format and display balance and timestamp information. This module imports the `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` constant from the `anchor_lang::solana_program::native_token` module and the `DateTime`, `NaiveDateTime`, and `Utc` types from the `chrono` crate.

1. `format_balance(lamports: u64) -> String`: This function takes an unsigned 64-bit integer `lamports` as input and returns a formatted string representing the balance in SOL (the native token of the Solana blockchain). It first converts the `lamports` value to a floating-point number by dividing it by the `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` constant. Then, it formats the resulting balance with a precision of 4 decimal places and a "⊚" symbol as a prefix. The formatted balance is returned as a `String`.

2. `format_timestamp(timestamp: i64) -> String`: This function takes a signed 64-bit integer `timestamp` as input and returns a formatted string representing the timestamp in RFC 2822 format. It first creates a `NaiveDateTime` object from the input `timestamp` using the `from_timestamp_opt` function, which returns an `Option` that is unwrapped to get the actual `NaiveDateTime` value. Then, it converts the `NaiveDateTime` object to a `DateTime<Utc>` object using the `from_utc` function, providing the `Utc` timezone. Finally, it formats the `DateTime<Utc>` object to a string using the `to_rfc2822` function and returns the result.

These utility functions can be used by other modules in the Clockwork project to display balance and timestamp information in a consistent and human-readable format. Developers working with this module should be familiar with the Solana blockchain, the `anchor_lang` library, and the `chrono` crate for handling date and time operations.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `format_balance` function?
   Answer: The `format_balance` function takes an input of lamports (u64) and converts it to a formatted string representing the balance in SOL (the native token of the Solana blockchain) with a precision of 4 decimal places.

2. Question: What is the purpose of the `format_timestamp` function?
   Answer: The `format_timestamp` function takes an input of a timestamp (i64) and converts it to a formatted string representing the date and time in RFC 2822 format.

3. Question: What is the significance of the `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` constant?
   Answer: The `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` constant represents the number of lamports in one SOL, which is used to convert the balance from lamports to SOL in the `format_balance` function.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp_opt` function call in the `format_timestamp` function?
   Answer: The `NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp_opt` function call is used to create a `NaiveDateTime` object from the input timestamp, which is then converted to a `DateTime<Utc>` object for formatting.

5. Question: What is the meaning of the "⊚" symbol in the `format_balance` function?
   Answer: The "⊚" symbol is a Unicode character used as a visual representation of the SOL token in the formatted balance string.
