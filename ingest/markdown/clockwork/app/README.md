The `README.md` file provides a brief set of instructions for developers to get started with the Clockwork project. Clockwork is likely a web application built using the Rust programming language and the Trunk build tool. The instructions guide developers on how to set up and run the project locally on their machines.

1. `cargo install trunk`: This command installs the Trunk build tool using Cargo, Rust's package manager. Trunk is a modern build tool and asset pipeline for Rust and WebAssembly applications. It is essential for building and bundling the Clockwork project's source code and assets.

2. `trunk serve`: This command starts the Trunk development server, which watches for changes in the project's source code and assets. When changes are detected, Trunk automatically rebuilds the project and refreshes the browser. This allows developers to see their changes in real-time without manually rebuilding and refreshing the application.

3. `localhost:8080`: This is the default address and port where the Trunk development server hosts the Clockwork application. Developers can visit this URL in their web browser to view and interact with the running application.

In summary, the `README.md` file provides a quick and straightforward guide for developers to set up and run the Clockwork project using the Trunk build tool. It assumes that the developer has Rust and Cargo installed on their machine. By following these instructions, developers can start working on the project and see their changes in real-time as they develop.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `cargo install trunk` command?
   Answer: The `cargo install trunk` command is used to install the Trunk build tool, which is a required dependency for building and serving the Clockwork project.

2. Question: What does the `trunk serve` command do?
   Answer: The `trunk serve` command builds and serves the Clockwork project, automatically rebuilding and refreshing the browser when changes are made to the source code.

3. Question: Is there any configuration required before running `trunk serve`?
   Answer: The provided instructions do not mention any configuration steps, so it is assumed that the default configuration should work out-of-the-box for the Clockwork project.

4. Question: Are there any prerequisites or dependencies that need to be installed before running the provided commands?
   Answer: The instructions do not mention any prerequisites or dependencies other than Trunk, but it is assumed that the developer has Rust and Cargo installed, as they are required to use Trunk.

5. Question: Can the port number for the local server be changed from the default `8080`?
   Answer: The instructions do not mention changing the port number, but it is likely that Trunk allows specifying a custom port number through command-line options or configuration files.
