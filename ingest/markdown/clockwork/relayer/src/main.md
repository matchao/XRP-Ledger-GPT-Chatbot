The `main.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for setting up and running a web server that provides various API endpoints related to secrets management and webhook relaying.

The file imports necessary libraries and modules, defines constants for file paths and the RPC URL, and sets up the main function to run the web server. The web server uses the Actix framework and is configured with CORS settings. It exposes the following API endpoints:

1. `/health`: A simple health check endpoint that returns "Ok".
2. `/relay`: Handles webhook relaying by fetching the webhook data, building the request, and sending it to the specified URL.
3. `/secret_create`: Encrypts a secret word using the ElGamal encryption scheme and saves the ciphertext to the filesystem.
4. `/secret_get`: Decrypts a secret word and returns it as a JSON response.
5. `/secret_list`: Lists all secrets for a given user.
6. `/secret_approve`: Adds a delegate to the list of approved users for a specific secret.
7. `/secret_revoke`: Removes a delegate from the list of approved users for a specific secret.

The file also includes utility functions for encryption, decryption, fetching secrets, and checking approval status. The encryption and decryption functions use the ElGamal encryption scheme, which is a public-key cryptosystem. The `fetch_decrypted_secret` and `fetch_secret` functions are used to retrieve secrets from the filesystem, while the `is_approved` function checks if a delegate is approved to access a secret.

Finally, the file includes a test module that verifies the correctness of the encryption and decryption functions.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `ENCRYPTION_KEYPAIR_PATH`, `SECRETS_PATH`, and `RPC_URL` constants?
   Answer: These constants define the file paths for the encryption keypair and secrets storage, as well as the URL for the RPC server. They are used throughout the code to access and store encryption keys, secrets, and interact with the RPC server.

2. Question: How does the `hydrate_secret` function work?
   Answer: The `hydrate_secret` function takes a phrase and a user's public key as input. It searches for a pattern in the phrase that represents a secret identifier, and if found, it checks if the user has permission to use the secret. If the user has permission, it fetches and decrypts the secret, replacing the secret identifier in the phrase with the decrypted secret.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `decrypt` and `encrypt` functions?
   Answer: The `decrypt` and `encrypt` functions are used to encrypt and decrypt secrets using the ElGamal encryption scheme. The `encrypt` function takes a keypair and a plaintext string as input and returns a ciphertext, while the `decrypt` function takes a keypair and a ciphertext as input and returns the decrypted plaintext string.

4. Question: How does the `is_approved` function work?
   Answer: The `is_approved` function checks if a delegate has permission to access a secret owned by a user. It takes the delegate's public key, the user's public key, and the secret name as input. It reads the list of current delegates for the secret and returns true if the delegate is the owner of the secret or is approved to use it.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the various `#[post("/...")]` functions, such as `secret_create`, `secret_get`, `secret_list`, etc.?
   Answer: These functions are Actix-web route handlers that define the behavior of the web server when receiving HTTP POST requests to the specified paths. They handle various actions related to secrets, such as creating, retrieving, listing, approving, and revoking secrets.
