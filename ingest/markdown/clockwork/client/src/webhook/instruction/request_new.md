The `request_new.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for creating a new HTTP request instruction in the Clockwork Webhook Program. The file imports necessary modules and objects from the `anchor_lang` and `clockwork_webhook_program` libraries, as well as the `HttpMethod` enum from the `clockwork_webhook_program::objects` module.

The main function in this file is `request_new`, which takes the following parameters:

- `api`: A `Pubkey` representing the API key for the Clockwork Webhook Program.
- `caller`: A `Pubkey` representing the caller's public key.
- `id`: A `String` representing the unique identifier for the request.
- `method`: An `HttpMethod` enum value representing the HTTP method for the request (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
- `payer`: A `Pubkey` representing the payer's public key.
- `route`: A `String` representing the route for the HTTP request.

The `request_new` function first retrieves the public keys for the configuration, pool, and request objects using the `pubkey()` method from their respective modules. It then creates a new `Instruction` object with the following properties:

- `program_id`: The Clockwork Webhook Program ID.
- `accounts`: A vector of `AccountMeta` objects representing the accounts involved in the instruction, including the API key, caller, clock system variable, configuration, payer, pool, request, and system program.
- `data`: The serialized data for the `RequestNew` instruction, which includes the `id`, `method`, and `route` parameters.

The `request_new` function returns the constructed `Instruction` object, which can be used by the Clockwork Webhook Program to process the HTTP request. This file is essential for developers working with the Clockwork project, as it provides a way to create new HTTP requests within the system.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `request_new` function?
   Answer: The `request_new` function is used to create a new Instruction for the Clockwork webhook program, which includes the necessary account metadata and data for making an HTTP request.

2. Question: What are the input parameters for the `request_new` function?
   Answer: The input parameters for the `request_new` function are `api` (Pubkey), `caller` (Pubkey), `id` (String), `method` (HttpMethod), `payer` (Pubkey), and `route` (String).

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `config_pubkey` and `pool_pubkey` variables?
   Answer: The `config_pubkey` variable is used to store the public key of the Clockwork webhook program's configuration object, while the `pool_pubkey` variable is used to store the public key of the Clockwork pool program's worker pool object.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `request_pubkey` variable?
   Answer: The `request_pubkey` variable is used to store the public key of the Clockwork webhook program's request object, which is generated based on the input parameters `api`, `caller`, and `id`.

5. Question: What is the structure of the `Instruction` object returned by the `request_new` function?
   Answer: The `Instruction` object returned by the `request_new` function includes the program ID of the Clockwork webhook program, a vector of `AccountMeta` objects representing the necessary accounts for the request, and the serialized data of the `RequestNew` object containing the `id`, `method`, and `route` parameters.
