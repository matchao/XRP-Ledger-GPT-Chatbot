The `parsing.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for parsing cron expressions and converting them into a `Schedule` struct. It uses the `nom` library for parsing and implements various parsing functions for different parts of a cron expression, such as ordinals, names, points, ranges, periods, and fields.

The file defines a `Field` struct that contains a vector of `RootSpecifier` values. It also implements the `FromStr` and `TryFrom<&str>` traits for the `Schedule` struct, which allows converting a cron expression string into a `Schedule` instance.

The `FromField` trait is implemented for types that implement the `TimeUnitField` trait. This trait provides a method `from_field` that takes a `Field` and returns a `Result<Self, Error>`. The implementation checks if the field contains a single `Specifier::All` value and returns an instance of the type with all ordinals set. Otherwise, it iterates through the specifiers, converts them into ordinals, validates them, and inserts them into an `OrdinalSet`. Finally, it creates an instance of the type from the `OrdinalSet`.

Various parsing functions are defined for different parts of a cron expression, such as `ordinal`, `name`, `point`, `named_point`, `period`, `range`, `named_range`, `all`, `any`, `specifier`, and `specifier_with_any`. These functions use the `nom` library's combinators to parse the input string and return the corresponding values.

The `schedule` function is the main entry point for parsing a cron expression. It uses the `all_consuming` combinator to ensure that the entire input string is parsed and calls either the `shorthand` or `longhand` function to parse the expression. The `shorthand` function handles predefined cron keywords like `@yearly`, `@monthly`, `@weekly`, `@daily`, and `@hourly`. The `longhand` function handles more complex cron expressions with specific fields for seconds, minutes, hours, days of the month, months, days of the week, and years.

The file also includes a `test` module that contains various unit tests for the parsing functions, ensuring that they work correctly for valid and invalid cron expressions.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `FromStr` and `TryFrom` implementations for the `Schedule` struct?
   Answer: The `FromStr` and `TryFrom` implementations for the `Schedule` struct provide a way to create a `Schedule` instance from a string representation of a cron expression. They handle parsing the expression and returning a `Result` containing either a valid `Schedule` or an error.

2. Question: How does the `FromField` trait work and what is its purpose?
   Answer: The `FromField` trait is implemented for types that can be created from a `Field` struct. It provides a method `from_field` that takes a `Field` as input and returns a `Result` containing either an instance of the implementing type or an error. This trait is used to convert parsed cron fields into their corresponding time unit fields.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `ordinal`, `name`, and `point` functions?
   Answer: These functions are used in the nom parsing process. The `ordinal` function parses a string into a u32 number, the `name` function parses a string into an alphabetic string, and the `point` function parses a string into a `Specifier::Point` variant containing a u32 number.

4. Question: How are the shorthand cron expressions (e.g., "@yearly", "@monthly") handled in the code?
   Answer: The shorthand cron expressions are handled by separate functions like `shorthand_yearly`, `shorthand_monthly`, etc. These functions parse the shorthand expressions and return a `ScheduleFields` instance with the appropriate time unit fields set according to the shorthand expression.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `schedule` function and how does it work?
   Answer: The `schedule` function is the main entry point for parsing a cron expression string into a `ScheduleFields` instance. It uses the nom parsing library to parse the input string and combines the results of the shorthand and longhand parsing functions. The function returns a `Result` containing either a valid `ScheduleFields` instance or an error.
