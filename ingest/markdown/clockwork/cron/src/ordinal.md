The `ordinal.rs` file is a part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for handling ordinal values and sets. It contains two main components: the `Ordinal` type alias and the `OrdinalSet` type alias.

1. `Ordinal`: This is a type alias for `u32`, which is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The purpose of using a type alias here is to provide a more descriptive name for the data type being used to represent ordinal values. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

2. `OrdinalSet`: This is a type alias for `BTreeSet<Ordinal>`. A `BTreeSet` is a sorted set data structure from the Rust standard library that is based on a B-Tree. It provides efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. In this case, the `BTreeSet` is used to store a collection of `Ordinal` values. The comment above the `OrdinalSet` definition suggests that there are plans to change this type alias to an enum in the future. The enum would have two variants: one for a `BTreeSet` of ordinals and another for an `All` option. The `All` option would be used to save space by representing a range of ordinals from `inclusive_min` to `inclusive_max` and answering membership queries without explicitly storing all the ordinals in the range.

In summary, the `ordinal.rs` file defines two type aliases, `Ordinal` and `OrdinalSet`, which are used to represent ordinal values and sets of ordinal values, respectively. The `OrdinalSet` is currently implemented as a `BTreeSet` of `Ordinal` values, but there are plans to change it to an enum in the future to save space when representing a range of ordinals.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Ordinal` type alias?
   Answer: The `Ordinal` type alias is used to represent an ordinal number as a 32-bit unsigned integer (u32).

2. Question: Why is the `OrdinalSet` currently implemented as a `BTreeSet`?
   Answer: The `OrdinalSet` is implemented as a `BTreeSet` to store a sorted set of unique `Ordinal` values, allowing for efficient insertion, removal, and search operations.

3. Question: What is the motivation behind the TODO comment suggesting to make `OrdinalSet` an enum?
   Answer: The motivation is to optimize the memory usage of `OrdinalSet` by introducing an `All` option, which can represent a range of ordinals without explicitly storing each value in the set.

4. Question: How would the `All` option in the proposed enum implementation of `OrdinalSet` handle membership queries?
   Answer: The `All` option would be able to answer membership queries by checking if a given ordinal is within the range of `inclusive_min` and `inclusive_max`.

5. Question: What are the potential benefits of using an enum for `OrdinalSet` instead of the current `BTreeSet` implementation?
   Answer: The benefits of using an enum for `OrdinalSet` include reduced memory usage when representing a range of ordinals and potentially faster membership queries for the `All` option, as it would only need to check the range boundaries.
