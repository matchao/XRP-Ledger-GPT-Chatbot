The `lib.rs` file is part of a project called Clockwork, which is a cron expression parser and schedule explorer written in Rust. The main purpose of this library is to parse cron expressions and provide an easy way to explore the schedule defined by the expression.

The file starts with a `#![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]` directive, which enforces the use of Rust 2018 idioms and will produce a compile-time error if any non-conforming code is found.

The code then provides an example of how to use the library, which demonstrates how to create a `Schedule` object from a cron expression string, and how to find the next timestamp in the schedule after a given timestamp.

The library consists of several modules:

1. `error`: This module defines the custom error types used by the library.
2. `ordinal`: This module provides utility functions for working with ordinal numbers (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
3. `parsing`: This module contains the logic for parsing cron expressions and converting them into a `Schedule` object.
4. `queries`: This module provides functions for querying the schedule, such as finding the next timestamp in the schedule.
5. `schedule`: This module defines the `Schedule` struct and its associated methods.
6. `specifier`: This module contains the logic for handling individual time unit specifiers in a cron expression (e.g., the hour field, the day of the week field, etc.).
7. `time_unit`: This module defines the `TimeUnitSpec` enum, which represents the different time units in a cron expression (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.).

The library also re-exports the `Schedule` struct and the `TimeUnitSpec` enum at the top level, so users can import them directly from the `clockwork_cron` crate.

In summary, the `lib.rs` file is the main entry point for the Clockwork cron expression parser and schedule explorer library. It provides an example of how to use the library and defines several modules that implement the parsing, querying, and representation of cron schedules.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `#![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]` line at the beginning of the code?
   Answer: This line is an attribute that tells the Rust compiler to deny any code that uses idioms that were considered outdated or deprecated in the 2018 edition of Rust. This helps ensure that the code follows the latest best practices and guidelines.

2. Question: What is the purpose of the `clockwork_cron::Schedule` struct and how is it used in the example code?
