The `specifier.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for defining and handling specifiers, which are used to represent different types of time intervals or points in time. This file contains two main structures: `Specifier` and `RootSpecifier`.

The `Specifier` enum has four variants:
1. `All`: Represents all possible values for a given time unit (e.g., all hours, minutes, or days).
2. `Point(Ordinal)`: Represents a specific point in time, such as a particular hour or day, using an `Ordinal` value.
3. `Range(Ordinal, Ordinal)`: Represents a range of time between two `Ordinal` values, such as a range of hours or days.
4. `NamedRange(String, String)`: Represents a range of time between two named points, such as days of the week (e.g., Monday to Thursday).

The `RootSpecifier` enum is used to create more advanced specifiers by combining a base `Specifier` with additional information. It has three variants:
1. `Specifier(Specifier)`: Represents a simple `Specifier` without any additional information.
2. `Period(Specifier, u32)`: Represents a period with a base `Specifier` and a step value (e.g., every 2 hours or every 3 days). This allows for more advanced intervals, such as '*/2', '10-2/2', or 'Mon-Thurs/2'.
3. `NamedPoint(String)`: Represents a named point in time, such as a specific day of the week (e.g., Monday).

The `impl From<Specifier> for RootSpecifier` block provides a way to convert a `Specifier` into a `RootSpecifier`. This is useful when you want to use a simple `Specifier` as a `RootSpecifier` without any additional information.

In summary, the `specifier.rs` file defines the structures and logic for handling different types of time intervals and points in time within the Clockwork project. It provides flexibility in representing various time-related specifications, such as simple points, ranges, and more advanced periods with step values.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Specifier` enum?
   Answer: The `Specifier` enum is used to represent different types of specifiers for the clockwork project, such as All, Point, Range, and NamedRange.

2. Question: Why is there a separate `RootSpecifier` enum?
   Answer: The `RootSpecifier` enum is separated from the `Specifier` enum to allow for a higher tiered specifier, enabling the representation of periods with base values that are more advanced than an ordinal, and avoiding invalid combinations.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `impl From<Specifier> for RootSpecifier` block?
   Answer: The `impl From<Specifier> for RootSpecifier` block provides a way to convert a `Specifier` into a `RootSpecifier` by implementing the `From` trait for the `RootSpecifier` type.

4. Question: What does the `Period` variant of the `RootSpecifier` enum represent?
   Answer: The `Period` variant of the `RootSpecifier` enum represents a period with a base specifier and a step value (u32), allowing for more advanced period specifications like '*/2', '10-2/2', and 'Mon-Thurs/2'.

5. Question: Why are the `Debug` and `PartialEq` traits derived for both `Specifier` and `RootSpecifier` enums?
   Answer: The `Debug` and `PartialEq` traits are derived for both `Specifier` and `RootSpecifier` enums to enable easy debugging and comparison of the enum values during development and testing.
