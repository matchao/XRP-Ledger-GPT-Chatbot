The `minutes.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and defines the `Minutes` struct and its associated methods. The purpose of this file is to handle the minutes component of a time unit in the project.

The file starts by importing necessary modules and types from the crate and the standard library. It imports `Ordinal` and `OrdinalSet` from the `ordinal` module, `TimeUnitField` from the `time_unit` module, and `Cow` from the `std::borrow` module.

The `Minutes` struct is defined with a single field, `ordinals`, which is an optional `OrdinalSet`. The struct derives `Clone`, `Debug`, and `Eq` traits for easy duplication, debugging, and equality comparison.

The `TimeUnitField` trait is implemented for the `Minutes` struct, which requires the implementation of several methods:

1. `from_optional_ordinal_set`: This method takes an optional `OrdinalSet` as input and returns a new `Minutes` instance with the given `ordinals` value.
2. `name`: This method returns the name of the time unit field as a `Cow<'static, str>`. In this case, it returns "Minutes".
3. `inclusive_min`: This method returns the minimum valid value for the minutes field, which is 0.
4. `inclusive_max`: This method returns the maximum valid value for the minutes field, which is 59.
5. `ordinals`: This method returns the `OrdinalSet` associated with the `Minutes` instance. If the `ordinals` field is `None`, it returns the supported ordinals for minutes, which is the default set of valid minute values.

Additionally, the `PartialEq` trait is implemented for the `Minutes` struct, which allows for comparison of two `Minutes` instances for equality. The `eq` method is implemented to compare the `ordinals` of the two instances.

In summary, the `minutes.rs` file defines the `Minutes` struct and its associated methods for handling the minutes component of a time unit in the Clockwork project. It provides functionality for creating, comparing, and working with minute values and their associated ordinal sets.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Minutes` struct and its fields?
   Answer: The `Minutes` struct represents a set of minutes in the clockwork project. It has a single field `ordinals`, which is an optional `OrdinalSet` representing the specific minutes.

2. Question: How does the `TimeUnitField` trait relate to the `Minutes` struct?
   Answer: The `Minutes` struct implements the `TimeUnitField` trait, which provides a set of methods for working with time unit fields like minutes, hours, etc.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `from_optional_ordinal_set` method in the `TimeUnitField` trait implementation for `Minutes`?
   Answer: The `from_optional_ordinal_set` method is used to create a new `Minutes` instance from an optional `OrdinalSet`. If the `ordinal_set` is `None`, the `Minutes` instance will have no specific minutes set.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `name` method in the `TimeUnitField` trait implementation for `Minutes`?
   Answer: The `name` method returns a string representation of the time unit field's name, in this case, "Minutes". This can be useful for displaying or logging purposes.

5. Question: How does the `PartialEq` implementation for `Minutes` work?
   Answer: The `PartialEq` implementation for `Minutes` compares two `Minutes` instances for equality by comparing their `ordinals` sets. If the sets are equal, the two instances are considered equal.
