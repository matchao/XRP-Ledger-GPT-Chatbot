The `days_of_week.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and defines a struct called `DaysOfWeek` that represents the days of the week in a scheduling context. It implements the `TimeUnitField` trait, which is used to define the behavior of time unit fields in the project.

The `DaysOfWeek` struct has a single field called `ordinals`, which is an optional `OrdinalSet`. An `OrdinalSet` is a collection of `Ordinal` values, where an `Ordinal` is an integer representing a specific day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.).

The `TimeUnitField` trait implementation for `DaysOfWeek` provides several methods:

1. `from_optional_ordinal_set`: This method creates a new `DaysOfWeek` instance from an optional `OrdinalSet`. If the `OrdinalSet` is `None`, the instance will represent all days of the week.
2. `name`: This method returns the name of the time unit field as a `Cow<'static, str>`, which is a clone-on-write smart pointer to a string. In this case, it returns "Days of Week".
3. `inclusive_min` and `inclusive_max`: These methods return the minimum and maximum valid `Ordinal` values for the days of the week, which are 1 and 7, respectively.
4. `ordinal_from_name`: This method takes a string reference as input and returns a `Result<Ordinal, Error>` that represents the `Ordinal` value corresponding to the input string. It supports various abbreviations and full names for the days of the week (e.g., "sun", "sunday", "mon", "monday", etc.). If the input string is not a valid day of the week, it returns an error.
5. `ordinals`: This method returns the `OrdinalSet` associated with the `DaysOfWeek` instance. If the `ordinals` field is `None`, it returns a default `OrdinalSet` representing all days of the week.

The `DaysOfWeek` struct also implements the `PartialEq` trait, which allows for comparison of two `DaysOfWeek` instances for equality. The `eq` method compares the `OrdinalSet` values of the two instances to determine if they are equal.

In summary, the `days_of_week.rs` file defines a struct and its associated behavior for representing and working with days of the week in the context of the Clockwork project.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `DaysOfWeek` struct and what does it represent?
   Answer: The `DaysOfWeek` struct represents a set of days of the week and is used to store the ordinals of the days in an `OrdinalSet`.

2. Question: How does the `TimeUnitField` trait relate to the `DaysOfWeek` struct?
   Answer: The `DaysOfWeek` struct implements the `TimeUnitField` trait, which provides methods for working with time unit fields, such as converting between names and ordinals, and getting the minimum and maximum valid ordinals.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `ordinal_from_name` function and how does it handle invalid input?
   Answer: The `ordinal_from_name` function takes a string representing the name of a day of the week and returns the corresponding ordinal value. If the input is not a valid day of the week, it returns an error with a message indicating the invalid input.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `ordinals` function and how does it handle cases when the `ordinals` field is `None`?
   Answer: The `ordinals` function returns the `OrdinalSet` of the `DaysOfWeek` struct. If the `ordinals` field is `None`, it returns the set of all supported ordinals for days of the week.

5. Question: How does the `PartialEq` implementation for `DaysOfWeek` determine if two instances are equal?
   Answer: The `PartialEq` implementation for `DaysOfWeek` compares the `OrdinalSet` of the two instances using the `ordinals` function. If the sets are equal, the instances are considered equal.
