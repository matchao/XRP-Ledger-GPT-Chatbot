The `years.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and defines a `Years` struct along with its associated methods and traits. The primary purpose of this file is to handle and manipulate years as a time unit field in the context of the project.

The file starts by importing necessary modules and types from the crate, such as `Ordinal`, `OrdinalSet`, and `TimeUnitField`. The `Years` struct is then defined with a single field, `ordinals`, which is an optional `OrdinalSet`. This field represents a set of years as ordinals.

The `Years` struct implements the `TimeUnitField` trait, which provides a set of methods for working with time unit fields. The `from_optional_ordinal_set` method is used to create a new `Years` instance from an optional `OrdinalSet`. The `name` method returns the name of the time unit field as a string, in this case, "Years". The `inclusive_min` and `inclusive_max` methods define the minimum and maximum supported years, respectively, which are 1970 and 2100. The `ordinals` method returns the `OrdinalSet` associated with the `Years` instance, or the supported ordinals if the set is not defined.

The file also includes a `TODO` comment, indicating that the current implementation may create a set with 100+ items each time the wildcard "*" is used, which is suboptimal and should be improved in the future.

Lastly, the `Years` struct implements the `PartialEq` trait, which allows for comparison of two `Years` instances for equality. The `eq` method compares the `OrdinalSet` of the two instances to determine if they are equal.

In summary, the `years.rs` file defines a `Years` struct for handling years as a time unit field in the Clockwork project, along with its associated methods and traits for manipulation and comparison.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Years` struct and its `ordinals` field?
   Answer: The `Years` struct represents a set of years, and the `ordinals` field is an optional `OrdinalSet` that stores the specific years in the set.

2. Question: What is the significance of the `TimeUnitField` trait implementation for `Years`?
   Answer: The `TimeUnitField` trait implementation for `Years` allows the `Years` struct to be used as a time unit field, providing methods for working with the set of years, such as getting the name, minimum and maximum supported years, and the ordinals in the set.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `name()` method and why does it return a `Cow<'static, str>`?
   Answer: The `name()` method returns the name of the time unit field, in this case "Years". It returns a `Cow<'static, str>` to allow for efficient string manipulation, as it can store either a borrowed string slice or an owned `String`.

4. Question: What is the issue mentioned in the TODO comment, and how might it be addressed?
   Answer: The issue is that using the default implementation of the `TimeUnitField` trait, a set with 100+ items will be created each time the wildcard "*" is used, which is inefficient. This could be addressed by implementing a more efficient way to handle wildcards in the `TimeUnitField` trait or in the `Years` struct.

5. Question: How does the `PartialEq` implementation for `Years` work, and why is it necessary?
   Answer: The `PartialEq` implementation for `Years` compares two `Years` instances by checking if their `ordinals()` method results are equal. This is necessary to allow for comparison of `Years` instances, which is useful for determining if two sets of years are the same.
