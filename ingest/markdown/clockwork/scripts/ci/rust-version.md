The `rust-version.sh` file is a Bash script used to manage Rust versions for the Clockwork project's Continuous Integration (CI) environment. It sets environment variables for stable and nightly Rust versions and provides a way to install or update the Rust toolchains as needed.

The script first checks if the `RUST_STABLE_VERSION` and `RUST_NIGHTLY_VERSION` environment variables are set. If not, it sets default values for the stable version (1.59.0) and the nightly version (2022-02-24). It then exports the following environment variables:

- `rust_stable`: The stable Rust version.
- `rust_stable_docker_image`: The Docker image for the stable Rust version, using the Solana Labs Rust image.
- `rust_nightly`: The nightly Rust version.
- `rust_nightly_docker_image`: The Docker image for the nightly Rust version, using the Solana Labs Rust nightly image.

The script also provides a way to install or update the Rust toolchains by sourcing the script with an argument (`all`, `stable`, or `nightly`). The `rustup_install` function is used to install the specified Rust toolchain if it's not already installed. The script then checks the provided argument and installs or updates the corresponding Rust toolchain(s).

To use the script, developers can source it without any arguments to set the environment variables without updating the toolchains:

```
$ source ci/rust-version.sh
```

To update both stable and nightly, only stable, or only nightly toolchains, developers can source the script with the corresponding argument:

```
$ source ci/rust-version.sh all
$ source ci/rust-version.sh stable
$ source ci/rust-version.sh nightly
```

After setting the environment variables, developers can build the project using either the stable or nightly Rust version:

```
$ cargo +"$rust_stable" build
$ cargo +"$rust_nightly" build
```
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of this script?
   Answer: The purpose of this script is to manage Rust versions for use in a CI environment, allowing users to easily switch between stable and nightly Rust versions.

2. Question: How does the script determine the stable and nightly Rust versions to use?
   Answer: The script uses the environment variables `RUST_STABLE_VERSION` and `RUST_NIGHTLY_VERSION` if they are set, otherwise it defaults to hardcoded values for the stable version (1.59.0) and the nightly version (2022-02-24).

3. Question: How can a developer use this script to update their Rust toolchain?
   Answer: A developer can source this script with an argument (all, stable, or nightly) to update their Rust toolchain accordingly. For example, running `source ci/rust-version.sh all` will update both stable and nightly Rust versions.

4. Question: What are the exported environment variables used for?
   Answer: The exported environment variables `rust_stable`, `rust_stable_docker_image`, `rust_nightly`, and `rust_nightly_docker_image` are used to store the Rust versions and corresponding Docker image names, which can be used in other scripts or CI configurations.

5. Question: How can a developer build their project with either the stable or nightly Rust version?
   Answer: After sourcing the script, a developer can use the `cargo +"$rust_stable"` or `cargo +"$rust_nightly"` commands to build their project with the specified Rust version. For example, running `cargo +"$rust_stable" build` will build the project using the stable Rust version.
