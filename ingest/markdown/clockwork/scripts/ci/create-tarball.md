The `create-tarball.sh` script is a bash script used in the Clockwork project to create a release tarball for the clockwork-geyser-plugin. The script is designed to work on both macOS (osx) and Linux environments.

1. The script first checks the operating system (CI_OS_NAME) and sets the appropriate target architecture:
   - For macOS, it checks the CPU type (uname -m) and sets the target to either arm64-apple-darwin or x86_64-apple-darwin.
   - For Linux, it sets the target to x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.
   - If the operating system is not supported, the script exits with an error message.

2. The script sets the RELEASE_BASENAME and TARBALL_BASENAME variables, which are used to name the release directory and tarball file. By default, these are set to "clockwork-geyser-plugin-release".

3. The script then creates a new release directory and writes a version.yml file containing the CI_TAG (channel) and TARGET (target architecture) information.

4. The script sources the `rust-version.sh` script to set the Rust version to "stable" and then calls the `build-all.sh` script to build the project using the specified Rust version and release directory.

5. After the build is complete, the script creates a tarball (tar) of the release directory, compresses it using bzip2, and copies the version.yml file to the same directory with the tarball.

6. Finally, the script prints "ok" to indicate successful completion.

This script is useful for developers who need to create a release tarball of the clockwork-geyser-plugin for distribution. It ensures that the tarball is created with the correct target architecture and includes the necessary version information.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `CI_OS_NAME` variable and how is it set?
   Answer: The `CI_OS_NAME` variable is used to determine the operating system (osx or linux) on which the script is running. It is expected to be set externally, likely by the continuous integration (CI) system.

2. Question: What is the purpose of the `_cputype` variable and how is it used?
   Answer: The `_cputype` variable is used to store the CPU architecture information (e.g., arm64 or x86_64) for the target system. It is used to set the `TARGET` variable, which is later used in naming the tarball.

3. Question: Why are some lines commented out, such as `# cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.."` and `# COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"`?
   Answer: These lines might be commented out because they are not currently needed or are being temporarily disabled for testing purposes. It's possible that they were used in a previous version of the script or might be needed in the future.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `RELEASE_BASENAME` and `TARBALL_BASENAME` variables?
   Answer: The `RELEASE_BASENAME` variable is used to set the base name for the release directory, while the `TARBALL_BASENAME` variable is used to set the base name for the tarball file. Both variables can be overridden by setting their values externally before running the script.

5. Question: What does the `./scripts/build-all.sh stable "${RELEASE_BASENAME}"` command do?
   Answer: This command runs the `build-all.sh` script located in the `./scripts` directory with the arguments "stable" and the value of the `RELEASE_BASENAME` variable. It is likely responsible for building the project binaries and placing them in the specified release directory.
