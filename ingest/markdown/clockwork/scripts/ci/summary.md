The `output/clockwork/scripts/ci` folder contains three Bash scripts that are essential for the Clockwork project's Continuous Integration (CI) environment. These scripts help manage Rust versions, create release tarballs, and print the Solana version used in the project.

1. `create-tarball.sh`: This script creates a release tarball for the clockwork-geyser-plugin, ensuring the correct target architecture and including necessary version information. It first checks the operating system and sets the appropriate target architecture. Then, it sets the RELEASE_BASENAME and TARBALL_BASENAME variables for naming the release directory and tarball file. The script creates a new release directory, writes a version.yml file with CI_TAG and TARGET information, and sources the `rust-version.sh` script to set the Rust version to "stable." It then calls the `build-all.sh` script to build the project using the specified Rust version and release directory. After the build is complete, the script creates a tarball of the release directory, compresses it using bzip2, and copies the version.yml file to the same directory with the tarball. Finally, the script prints "ok" to indicate successful completion.

2. `rust-version.sh`: This script manages Rust versions for the Clockwork project's CI environment. It sets environment variables for stable and nightly Rust versions and provides a way to install or update the Rust toolchains as needed. The script checks if the `RUST_STABLE_VERSION` and `RUST_NIGHTLY_VERSION` environment variables are set and sets default values if not. It then exports environment variables for the stable and nightly Rust versions and their corresponding Docker images. The script also provides a way to install or update the Rust toolchains by sourcing the script with an argument (`all`, `stable`, or `nightly`). The `rustup_install` function is used to install the specified Rust toolchain if it's not already installed. Developers can source the script without any arguments to set the environment variables without updating the toolchains or with the corresponding argument to update the toolchains.

3. `solana-version.sh`: This script prints the version of Solana used in the Clockwork project. It is useful for developers who need to know the exact version of Solana for compatibility or debugging purposes. The script changes the current working directory to the `plugin` folder and uses the `cargo read-manifest` command to read the `Cargo.toml` file. The output is piped to the `jq` command, which filters and extracts the required information from the JSON output. The script looks for the dependency with the name `"solana-geyser-plugin-interface"` and extracts the version requirement, printing it to the console.

In summary, the `output/clockwork/scripts/ci` folder contains essential scripts for managing the Clockwork project's CI environment. These scripts help developers create release tarballs, manage Rust versions, and determine the Solana version used in the project. This information is crucial for ensuring compatibility, debugging issues, and maintaining a smooth development process.
