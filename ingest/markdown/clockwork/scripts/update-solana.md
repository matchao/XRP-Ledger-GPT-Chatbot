The `update-solana.sh` script is a Bash script used to update the version of Solana in a project called Clockwork. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Prompt the user for the new version of Solana to be used in the project. The user input is stored in the `new_version` variable.

2. Find all the `Cargo.toml` files in the project. These files are used by the Rust programming language's package manager, Cargo, to manage dependencies and build configurations. The script uses the `find` command to search for all files named `Cargo.toml` in the current directory and its subdirectories. The results are stored in an array called `cargo_tomls`.

3. Update the Solana version in each `Cargo.toml` file. The script iterates through the `cargo_tomls` array and uses the `sed` command to perform a find-and-replace operation. It searches for lines starting with "solana-" and replaces the version number with the new version provided by the user. The `-i` flag is used to edit the files in-place, and the `-e` flag is used to specify the search and replace expression.

4. Update the Solana version in the `Dockerfile`. The script uses the `sed` command again to find and replace the Solana version in the `Dockerfile`. It searches for lines starting with "ENV SOLANA_VERSION=v" and replaces the version number with the new version provided by the user. The `-i` and `-e` flags are used in the same way as in step 3.

In summary, the `update-solana.sh` script is used to update the Solana version in a Clockwork project by modifying the `Cargo.toml` files and the `Dockerfile`. Developers can use this script to easily update the Solana dependency across the entire project.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of this script?
   Answer: The purpose of this script is to update the version of Solana in all Cargo.toml files and the Dockerfile in the project.

2. Question: How does the script get the new version of Solana to update?
   Answer: The script prompts the user to input the new version by using the `read` command and stores it in the `new_version` variable.

3. Question: How does the script find all the Cargo.toml files in the project?
   Answer: The script uses the `find` command to search for all files named "Cargo.toml" in the current directory and its subdirectories, and stores the file paths in the `cargo_tomls` array.

4. Question: How does the script update the version of Solana in the Cargo.toml files?
   Answer: The script uses a `for` loop to iterate through each Cargo.toml file, and then uses the `sed` command to find and replace the Solana version with the new version provided by the user.

5. Question: How does the script update the version of Solana in the Dockerfile?
   Answer: The script uses the `sed` command to find and replace the Solana version in the Dockerfile by searching for the line starting with "ENV SOLANA_VERSION=v" and updating the version after the "v" with the new version provided by the user.
