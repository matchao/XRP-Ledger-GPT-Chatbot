The `bump-version.sh` script is a Bash script used to automate the process of updating the version number of the Clockwork project and its components. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Retrieves the current version number from the `VERSION` file and prompts the user to input the new version number.
2. Builds the project using `cargo build` with the `--deny warnings` flag to ensure there are no warnings in the code.
3. Updates the version number in the `Cargo.toml` files of the libraries (libs), programs, and other components (client, cli, plugin, sdk, and utils) using the `sed` command.
4. Updates the dependencies in the `Cargo.toml` files of the programs and other components to use the new version number.
5. Writes the new version number to the `VERSION` file.
6. Rebuilds the project using `cargo build`.
7. Commits the changes to the Git repository, creates a new Git tag with the new version number, and pushes the changes and tags to the remote repository.

This script is useful for developers who need to update the version number of the Clockwork project and its components in a consistent and automated manner. It ensures that all the necessary files are updated with the new version number and that the project builds successfully before committing the changes.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of this script?

   Answer: This comment suggests that the developer intends to borrow or adapt the `increment-cargo-version.sh` script from the Solana project to improve or replace the current version bumping process in this script.

3. Question: How does the script determine the current version of the project?
   Answer: The script reads the current version from the `VERSION` file using the command `cat ./VERSION` and stores it in the `current_version` variable.

4. Question: How does the script handle updating the version number in various Cargo.toml files?
   Answer: The script uses `sed` commands to search and replace the version number in the Cargo.toml files of the various components, such as libraries, programs, and dependencies.

5. Question: How does the script handle Git operations after updating the version number?
   Answer: After updating the version number and rebuilding the project, the script stages all changes using `git add .`, commits the changes with a message indicating the version bump, creates a new Git tag with the new version number, and pushes the changes and tags to the remote repository.
