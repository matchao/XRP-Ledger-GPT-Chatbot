The `mint-token.sh` file is a shell script that automates the process of creating and minting a new SPL token using the Solana Program Library (SPL) Token command-line interface. The script performs three main tasks: creating a new mint, creating a token account, and minting a specified number of tokens to the current keypair.

1. Create mint: The script starts by creating a new mint using the `spl-token create-token` command. The output of this command is piped to the `grep` command to filter the line containing the phrase 'Creating token'. The mint address is then extracted from the filtered line by taking the last 44 characters, which is the length of a Solana address.

2. Create token account: Next, the script creates a new token account associated with the previously created mint using the `spl-token create-account` command followed by the mint address. Similar to the previous step, the output is filtered using `grep` to find the line containing 'Creating account', and the account address is extracted by taking the last 44 characters.

3. Mint tokens: Finally, the script mints a specified number of tokens (in this case, 10) to the current keypair using the `spl-token mint` command followed by the mint address and the desired balance. The current keypair is assumed to be the default keypair used by the SPL Token CLI.

In summary, the `mint-token.sh` script automates the process of creating a new SPL token, creating an associated token account, and minting a specified number of tokens to the current keypair. This script can be useful for developers working with the Solana blockchain and SPL tokens, as it simplifies the process of token creation and minting.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of this script?
   Answer: The purpose of this script is to create a new SPL token, create a token account for that token, and mint 10 tokens to the current keypair.

2. Question: How is the mint address extracted from the `spl-token create-token` command output?
   Answer: The mint address is extracted by using the `grep` command to filter the output for the line containing 'Creating token', and then taking the last 44 characters of that line.

3. Question: How is the token account address extracted from the `spl-token create-account` command output?
   Answer: The token account address is extracted by using the `grep` command to filter the output for the line containing 'Creating account', and then taking the last 44 characters of that line.

4. Question: Can the number of tokens minted be easily changed?
   Answer: Yes, the number of tokens minted can be easily changed by modifying the `balance` variable value in the script.

5. Question: Is there any error handling or validation in this script?
   Answer: No, there is no error handling or validation in this script, so if any of the commands fail or produce unexpected output, the script may not work as intended.
