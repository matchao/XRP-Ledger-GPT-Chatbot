The `explorer.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and defines the `Explorer` struct and its associated methods. The purpose of this file is to generate URLs for the Solana blockchain explorer and the Clockwork explorer based on the given network (mainnet, testnet, devnet, or custom).

There are two constants defined at the beginning of the file:
- `EXPLORER_URL`: The base URL for the Solana blockchain explorer.
- `CK_EXPLORER_URL`: The base URL for the Clockwork explorer.

The `Explorer` struct has two fields:
- `cluster`: A string representing the network (mainnet, testnet, devnet, or custom).
- `custom_rpc`: An optional string representing the custom RPC URL for a custom network.

The `impl From<String> for Explorer` block defines a conversion from a `String` to an `Explorer` instance. It checks if the input string contains "devnet", "testnet", or "mainnet" and creates the corresponding `Explorer` instance. If none of these are found, it creates a custom `Explorer` instance.

The `impl Explorer` block defines the following methods:
- `mainnet()`: Creates an `Explorer` instance for the mainnet network.
- `testnet()`: Creates an `Explorer` instance for the testnet network.
- `devnet()`: Creates an `Explorer` instance for the devnet network.
- `custom(custom_rpc: String)`: Creates an `Explorer` instance for a custom network with the given custom RPC URL.

There are two additional methods for generating URLs:
- `tx_url<T: std::fmt::Display>(&self, tx: T) -> String`: Generates a URL for a transaction on the Solana blockchain explorer. If the network is custom, it appends the custom RPC URL as a query parameter.
- `thread_url<T: std::fmt::Display, U: std::fmt::Display>(&self, thread: T, program_id: U) -> String`: Generates a URL for a thread on the Clockwork explorer. If the network is custom, it appends the custom RPC URL as a query parameter.

In summary, the `explorer.rs` file provides a way to create `Explorer` instances for different networks and generate URLs for the Solana blockchain explorer and Clockwork explorer based on the network.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Explorer` struct and its fields?
   Answer: The `Explorer` struct represents an explorer for the Solana blockchain, with fields `cluster` representing the network type (mainnet, testnet, devnet, or custom) and `custom_rpc` representing the custom RPC URL if the network type is custom.

2. Question: How does the `From<String>` trait implementation work for the `Explorer` struct?
   Answer: The `From<String>` trait implementation allows creating an `Explorer` instance from a given JSON-RPC URL string by matching the network type (devnet, testnet, mainnet, or custom) based on the URL content.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `tx_url` method in the `Explorer` struct?
   Answer: The `tx_url` method generates a transaction URL for the Solana explorer based on the given transaction ID and the network type (mainnet, testnet, devnet, or custom).

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `thread_url` method in the `Explorer` struct?
   Answer: The `thread_url` method generates a thread URL for the Clockwork explorer based on the given thread ID, program ID, and the network type (mainnet, testnet, devnet, or custom).

5. Question: How does the `Explorer` struct handle custom network types and custom RPC URLs?
   Answer: The `Explorer` struct handles custom network types by setting the `cluster` field to "custom" and storing the custom RPC URL in the `custom_rpc` field. The `tx_url` and `thread_url` methods then append the custom RPC URL as a query parameter when generating URLs for custom networks.
