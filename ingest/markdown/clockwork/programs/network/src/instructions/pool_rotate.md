The `pool_rotate.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for handling the rotation of workers in a pool. The file contains the `PoolRotate` struct, which defines the accounts required for the pool rotation process, and two functions: `handler` and `is_rotation_window_open`.

The `PoolRotate` struct contains the following accounts:

- `config`: The global configuration account.
- `pool`: The pool account that needs to be rotated, with mutable access.
- `registry`: The registry account.
- `signatory`: The signer account.
- `snapshot`: The snapshot account, with a constraint that its ID must be equal to the current epoch of the registry.
- `snapshot_frame`: The snapshot frame account, which has a one-to-one relationship with the snapshot and worker accounts.
- `worker`: The worker account, which has a one-to-one relationship with the signatory account.

The `handler` function is the main entry point for the pool rotation process. It takes a `Context<PoolRotate>` as input and returns a `Result<()>`. The function performs the following steps:

1. Get the accounts from the context.
2. Verify if the pool has excess space or if the worker can rotate in at this time. If not, return a `ClockworkError::PoolFull` error.
3. Verify if the worker is not already in the pool. If it is, return a `ClockworkError::AlreadyInPool` error.
4. Rotate the worker into the pool.

The `is_rotation_window_open` function checks if the rotation window is open for a given registry, snapshot, and snapshot frame. It takes references to the `Account<Registry>`, `Account<Snapshot>`, and `Account<SnapshotFrame>` as input and returns a `Result<bool>`. The function calculates the sample by taking the remainder of the registry nonce divided by the snapshot's total stake. If the sample is within the stake range of the snapshot frame, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that there is a TODO comment at the beginning of the file, suggesting that the pool rotation should be made a function of the epoch pubkey, and workers should self-select into the delegate pool on deterministic epochs. If a worker is not active, they will not rotate into the pool, giving current workers extra time in the pool.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `PoolRotate` struct and its associated fields?
   Answer: The `PoolRotate` struct is used to define the account information required for the pool rotation process. It includes fields for the configuration, pool, registry, signatory, snapshot, snapshot frame, and worker accounts.

2. Question: What does the `handler` function do in this code?
   Answer: The `handler` function is the main entry point for the pool rotation process. It verifies if the pool has excess space or if the worker can rotate in at this time, checks if the worker is not already in the pool, and then rotates the worker into the pool.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `is_rotation_window_open` function?
   Answer: The `is_rotation_window_open` function checks if the rotation window is open for a worker to join the pool. It returns true if the sample is within the entry's stake range, otherwise, it returns false.

4. Question: What are the TODO comments suggesting to be implemented in the future?
   Answer: The TODO comments suggest making pool rotation a function of the epoch pubkey, allowing workers to self-select into the delegate pool on deterministic epochs. If a worker is not active, they will not rotate into the pool, giving current workers (presumably active) extra time in the pool.

5. Question: What error is raised if the worker is already in the pool?
   Answer: If the worker is already in the pool, the `ClockworkError::AlreadyInPool` error is raised.
