The `worker.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and defines the structure and behavior of a Worker in the system. A Worker is an entity that performs tasks and earns commissions for running the tasks. The file contains three main components: the `Worker` struct, the `WorkerSettings` struct, and the `WorkerAccount` trait.

1. `Worker` struct: This structure defines the properties of a Worker, which include:
   - `authority`: The owner of the worker (a public key).
   - `commission_balance`: The number of lamports (the smallest unit of the native token) claimable by the authority as commission for running the worker.
   - `commission_rate`: A percentage (0-100) of fees the worker will keep as commission.
   - `id`: The worker's unique identifier.
   - `signatory`: The worker's signatory address (a public key) used to sign transactions.
   - `total_delegations`: The number of delegations allocated to this worker.

   The `Worker` struct also has an associated method `pubkey` that takes a worker's ID and returns the worker's public key.

2. `WorkerSettings` struct: This structure defines the settings for a Worker, which include:
   - `commission_rate`: The commission rate for the worker.
   - `signatory`: The worker's signatory public key.

   The `WorkerSettings` struct derives `AnchorSerialize` and `AnchorDeserialize` traits for serialization and deserialization.

3. `WorkerAccount` trait: This trait defines the behavior of a Worker account and has three methods:
   - `pubkey`: Returns the worker's public key.
   - `init`: Initializes a worker account with the given authority, ID, and signatory. It sets the commission balance to 0, commission rate to 0, and total delegations to 0.
   - `update`: Updates the worker's settings (commission rate and signatory) with the given `WorkerSettings`. It checks if the commission rate is between 0 and 100 and if the signatory is not equal to the authority.

The `WorkerAccount` trait is implemented for the `Account<'_, Worker>` type, which allows the methods to be called on an instance of the `Worker` struct wrapped in an `Account` type.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Worker` struct?
   Answer: The `Worker` struct represents a worker in the clockwork project, containing information such as the worker's authority, commission balance, commission rate, id, signatory address, and the total number of delegations allocated to the worker.

2. Question: How is the `pubkey` function in the `Worker` struct used?
   Answer: The `pubkey` function is used to generate a unique program address for a worker based on their id and the constant `SEED_WORKER`.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `WorkerSettings` struct?
   Answer: The `WorkerSettings` struct is used to store the settings for a worker, such as the commission rate and the signatory address.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `WorkerAccount` trait?
   Answer: The `WorkerAccount` trait defines the required methods for a worker account, such as `pubkey`, `init`, and `update`. This trait is implemented for the `Account<'_, Worker>` type.

5. Question: What are the requirements for updating the worker settings in the `update` function?
   Answer: The `update` function requires that the new commission rate is between 0 and 100 (inclusive), and the new signatory address must not be the same as the worker's authority address. If these conditions are not met, the function will return an error.
