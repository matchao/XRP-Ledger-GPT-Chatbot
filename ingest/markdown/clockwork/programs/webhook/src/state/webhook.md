The `webhook.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for defining the structure and behavior of webhooks within the system. A webhook is a mechanism for sending HTTP requests when specific events occur. In this file, several data structures and traits are defined to handle webhooks, their methods, and relayers.

1. `Webhook` struct: This is the main data structure representing a webhook. It contains fields such as `authority`, `body`, `created_at`, `headers`, `id`, `method`, `relayer`, `url`, and `workers`. The `Webhook` struct also implements a method `pubkey` that takes an authority and an ID and returns a program address based on the provided inputs.

2. `WebhookAccount` trait: This trait is implemented for the `Account` type with a `Webhook` as its associated data. It defines a single method, `pubkey`, which returns the public key of the webhook account.

3. `HttpMethod` enum: This enumeration represents the supported HTTP methods for webhooks, which are `Get` and `Post`. It also implements the `Display` trait for pretty-printing and the `FromStr` trait for parsing strings into `HttpMethod` instances.

4. `Relayer` enum: This enumeration represents the relayer types for webhooks. It has two variants: `Clockwork` and `Custom`. The `Custom` variant takes a `String` as its associated data.

The file also imports necessary modules and dependencies, such as `std`, `anchor_lang`, and `serde`. Additionally, it defines a constant `SEED_WEBHOOK` which is a byte slice containing the string "webhook". This constant is used as a seed for generating program addresses.

In summary, the `webhook.rs` file defines the core data structures and behavior for webhooks in the Clockwork project, including the main `Webhook` struct, the `WebhookAccount` trait, and the `HttpMethod` and `Relayer` enums.
## Questions: 
 1. Question: What is the purpose of the `Webhook` struct and its fields?
   Answer: The `Webhook` struct represents a webhook object with fields such as authority, body, created_at, headers, id, method, relayer, url, and workers, which store information about the webhook, such as the authority that created it, the request body, headers, HTTP method, relayer type, target URL, and associated worker public keys.

2. Question: How is the `pubkey` function in the `Webhook` struct used?
   Answer: The `pubkey` function is used to generate a unique program address (public key) for a webhook based on the authority's public key and the webhook's id, using the constant `SEED_WEBHOOK` as a seed.

3. Question: What is the purpose of the `WebhookAccount` trait and its implementation for `Account<'_, Webhook>`?
   Answer: The `WebhookAccount` trait defines a common interface for types that can provide a public key for a webhook. The implementation for `Account<'_, Webhook>` allows an account holding a `Webhook` to provide its public key using the `Webhook::pubkey` function.

4. Question: What is the purpose of the `HttpMethod` enum and its associated implementations?
   Answer: The `HttpMethod` enum represents the supported HTTP methods (GET and POST) for a webhook. The `Display` and `FromStr` implementations allow for conversion between the enum and its string representation, enabling easy parsing and display of the HTTP method.

5. Question: What is the purpose of the `Relayer` enum and its variants?
   Answer: The `Relayer` enum represents the type of relayer used for the webhook, with two possible variants: `Clockwork` for the default Clockwork relayer, and `Custom(String)` for a custom relayer specified by a string.
