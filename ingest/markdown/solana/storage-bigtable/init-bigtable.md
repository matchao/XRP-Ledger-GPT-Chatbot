The `init-bigtable.sh` script is used to configure a BigTable instance with the expected tables for the Solana project. BigTable is a NoSQL database service provided by Google Cloud Platform that is used to store large amounts of data in a distributed manner. The purpose of this script is to create and configure the necessary tables in the BigTable instance for the Solana project to function properly.

The script starts by setting the `instance` variable to `solana-ledger`, which is the name of the BigTable instance that will be used. It then sets up the `cbt` command, which is a command-line tool used to interact with BigTable. The `cbt` command is configured to use the `solana-ledger` instance by default, but if the `BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable is set, it will use the emulator project instead.

The script then loops through three tables: `blocks`, `tx`, and `tx-by-addr`. For each table, it creates the table using the `createtable` command, creates a family named `x` using the `createfamily` command, and sets the garbage collection policy for the `x` family using the `setgcpolicy` command. The garbage collection policy is set to keep only one version of each cell (`maxversions=1`) and to delete cells that are older than 360 days (`maxage=360d`).

Overall, this script is an important part of the Solana project's infrastructure, as it sets up the necessary tables in the BigTable instance that will be used to store important data for the project. Without this script, the Solana project would not be able to function properly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script configures a BigTable instance with expected tables for the Solana project.

2. What is the significance of the `set -e` command?
    
    The `set -e` command causes the script to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status, indicating an error.

3. What tables are being created and what is the significance of the `setgcpolicy` commands?
    
    The script creates three tables: `blocks`, `tx`, and `tx-by-addr`. The `setgcpolicy` commands set the garbage collection policy for the `x` column family in each table, specifying that only the most recent version of each cell should be retained (`maxversions=1`) and that cells older than 360 days should be deleted (`maxage=360d`).
