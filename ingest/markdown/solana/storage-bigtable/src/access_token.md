The `access_token.rs` file is a module for managing a Google API access token. It provides a struct `AccessToken` that contains the credentials, scope, refresh_active, and token. The `AccessToken` struct has several methods that allow for the creation of a new access token, refreshing the token, and getting the token.

The `AccessToken` struct has a `new` method that takes in a `Scope` and a `CredentialType` and returns a `Result<Self, String>`. The `Scope` is the scope of the access token, and the `CredentialType` is either a `Filepath` or a `Stringified` credential. The `new` method loads the credentials based on the `CredentialType` and checks if the RSA key is valid. If the RSA key is valid, it creates a new `AccessToken` struct and returns it.

The `AccessToken` struct has a `refresh` method that refreshes the access token if it is about to expire. The `refresh` method checks if it is time to refresh the token and if there is already a refresh pending. If it is time to refresh the token and there is no refresh pending, it refreshes the token and updates the `token` field of the `AccessToken` struct.

The `AccessToken` struct has a `get` method that returns the access token suitable for use in an HTTP authorization header. The `get` method reads the `token` field of the `AccessToken` struct and returns the access token.

Overall, this module provides a way to manage a Google API access token and ensure that it does not expire. It can be used in the larger project to authenticate requests to the Google API. For example, the `get` method can be used to get the access token and add it to the HTTP authorization header of a request to the Google API.
