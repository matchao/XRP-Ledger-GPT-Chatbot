The `compression.rs` file contains functions and an enum for compressing and decompressing data using different compression methods. The `CompressionMethod` enum lists the available compression methods, including `NoCompression`, `Bzip2`, `Gzip`, and `Zstd`. 

The `decompress_reader` function takes a `CompressionMethod` and a reader object and returns a boxed reader object that can be used to read decompressed data. The function creates a `BufReader` object from the input reader and then creates a boxed reader object based on the compression method. If the method is `Bzip2`, the function creates a `BzDecoder` object from the `bzip2` crate. If the method is `Gzip`, the function creates a `GzDecoder` object from the `flate2` crate. If the method is `Zstd`, the function creates a `Decoder` object from the `zstd` crate. If the method is `NoCompression`, the function returns the `BufReader` object as is. 

The `decompress` function takes a byte slice and returns a vector of bytes that have been decompressed using the method specified in the input data. The function first checks that the input data is large enough to contain the compression method information. It then deserializes the compression method from the input data and creates a reader object using the `decompress_reader` function. The function reads the decompressed data from the reader object and returns it as a vector of bytes. 

The `compress` function takes a `CompressionMethod` and a byte slice and returns a vector of bytes that have been compressed using the specified method. The function serializes the compression method and creates a compressed data vector based on the compression method. If the method is `Bzip2`, the function creates a `BzEncoder` object from the `bzip2` crate and writes the input data to it. If the method is `Gzip`, the function creates a `GzEncoder` object from the `flate2` crate and writes the input data to it. If the method is `Zstd`, the function creates an `Encoder` object from the `zstd` crate and writes the input data to it. If the method is `NoCompression`, the function simply returns the input data as is. 

The `compress_best` function takes a byte slice and returns a vector of bytes that have been compressed using the best compression method. The function iterates over all available compression methods and compresses the input data using each method. It then returns the compressed data with the smallest size. 

The `test` module contains two tests. The `test_compress_uncompress` test compresses and then decompresses a vector of bytes and checks that the decompressed data is equal to the original data. The `test_compress` test compresses a vector of bytes and checks that the compressed data is smaller than the original data. 

Overall, this file provides a set of functions for compressing and decompressing data using different compression methods. These functions can be used in other parts of the project to reduce the size of data that needs to be stored or transmitted. The `compress_best` function is particularly useful as it automatically selects the best compression method based on the input data.
## Questions: 
 1. What compression algorithms are supported by this code?
- This code supports Bzip2, Gzip, Zstd, and no compression.

2. How does the `compress_best` function work?
- The `compress_best` function compresses the input data using all supported compression methods and returns the compressed data with the smallest size.

3. What is the purpose of the `CompressionMethod` enum?
- The `CompressionMethod` enum defines the compression methods that can be used by the `compress` and `decompress` functions.
