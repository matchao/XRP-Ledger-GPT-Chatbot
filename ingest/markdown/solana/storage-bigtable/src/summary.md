The `solana/storage-bigtable/src` folder contains modules for managing Google API access tokens, compressing and decompressing data, and loading root certificates for secure communication.

The `access_token.rs` module provides a struct `AccessToken` for managing Google API access tokens. It has methods for creating a new access token, refreshing the token, and getting the token. This can be used to authenticate requests to the Google API, for example:

```rust
let access_token = AccessToken::new(scope, credential_type).unwrap();
let token = access_token.get().unwrap();
// Use the token in the HTTP authorization header of a request to the Google API
```

The `compression.rs` module provides functions and an enum for compressing and decompressing data using different compression methods. This can be used to reduce the size of data that needs to be stored or transmitted. The `compress_best` function is particularly useful as it automatically selects the best compression method based on the input data:

```rust
let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let compressed_data = compress_best(&data);
let decompressed_data = decompress(&compressed_data).unwrap();
assert_eq!(data, decompressed_data);
```

The `root_ca_certificate.rs` module contains a function `load()` that loads a root certificate for use in secure communication. This can be used to verify the identity of a remote server during secure communication, for example:

```rust
use solana::storage_bigtable::root_ca_certificate;

fn main() {
    let certificate = root_ca_certificate::load().unwrap();
    // Use the certificate to establish a secure connection with a remote server
}
```

These modules can be used together in the larger project to manage access tokens, compress and decompress data, and establish secure communication with remote servers. For example, the `access_token.rs` module can be used to authenticate requests to the Google API, while the `compression.rs` module can be used to compress data before sending it to the API. The `root_ca_certificate.rs` module can be used to verify the identity of the remote server during secure communication.
