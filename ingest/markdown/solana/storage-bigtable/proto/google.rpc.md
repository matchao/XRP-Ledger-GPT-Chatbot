The code defines a message type called `Status` which is used to represent logical errors in different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The `Status` message is used by gRPC, a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.

The `Status` message has three fields:
- `code`: an integer representing the error code. The error code should be an enum value of `google.rpc.Code`.
- `message`: a string representing a developer-facing error message in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the `details` field or localized by the client.
- `details`: a list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

This message type is useful in the larger project because it provides a standardized way to represent errors across different programming environments. By using the `Status` message, developers can easily communicate errors between different parts of the system and handle them in a consistent way.

Here is an example of how the `Status` message might be used in a gRPC service:
```rust
use solana::storage_bigtable::proto::google::rpc::{Status, Code};

fn my_grpc_service(request: MyRequest) -> Result<MyResponse, Status> {
    // do some work
    if error_occurred {
        return Err(Status {
            code: Code::Internal as i32,
            message: "An internal error occurred".to_string(),
            details: vec![],
        });
    }
    // return response
}
```
In this example, if an error occurs during the processing of the request, the service returns a `Status` message with an error code of `Code::Internal` and an error message of "An internal error occurred". The `details` field is empty in this case, but it could be used to provide additional information about the error.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Status` type and where is it used?
- The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC.
2. What data does each `Status` message contain?
- Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
3. How should user-facing error messages be handled?
- User-facing error messages should be localized and sent in the `google.rpc.Status.details` field, or localized by the client. The `message` field should only contain a developer-facing error message in English.
