The `solana/gossip/src/ping_pong.rs` file contains the implementation of the Ping-Pong protocol for the Solana gossip network. The purpose of this protocol is to maintain records of remote nodes that have returned a valid response to a ping message and manage on-the-fly ping messages pending a pong response from the remote node.

The file defines two main structs: `Ping` and `Pong`. The `Ping` struct represents a ping message sent to a remote node, containing a sender's public key, a token, and a signature. The `Pong` struct represents a pong message sent in response to a received ping, containing the sender's public key, a hash of the received ping token, and a signature.

The `PingCache` struct is responsible for managing the state of the Ping-Pong protocol. It maintains three LRU caches: `pings`, `pongs`, and `pending_cache`. The `pings` cache stores the timestamp of the last ping message sent to a remote node, used to rate limit pings. The `pongs` cache stores verified pong responses from remote nodes. The `pending_cache` stores the hash of ping tokens sent out to remote nodes, pending a pong response back.

The `PingCache` provides methods to add a pong message, check if a remote node has responded to a ping message, and generate new ping messages if necessary. The `add` method checks if the pong hash, pubkey, and socket match a previously sent ping message. If so, it records the current timestamp for the remote node and returns true. The `check` method returns true if the remote node has responded to a ping message and removes expired pong messages. If the pong message is not too recent and the node has not been pinged recently, it generates a new ping message to extend remote node verification.

In summary, this file implements the Ping-Pong protocol for the Solana gossip network, allowing nodes to maintain records of remote nodes that have responded to ping messages and manage pending ping messages awaiting pong responses.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PingCache` struct and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `PingCache` struct maintains records of remote nodes that have returned a valid response to a ping message, as well as on-the-fly ping messages pending a pong response from the remote node. Its methods are used to add pong responses, check if a remote node has responded to a ping message, and generate new ping messages when necessary.

2. **Question**: How does the `Ping` and `Pong` structs work together in the ping-pong process?
   **Answer**: The `Ping` struct represents a ping message sent to a remote node, containing a token and a signature. The `Pong` struct represents a pong message sent back from the remote node in response to a ping, containing a hash of the received ping token and a signature. The `Pong` struct is created using the `Ping` struct, and the `PingCache` uses both structs to maintain records of remote nodes and their responses.

3. **Question**: How does the rate limiting and time-to-live (TTL) mechanism work in the `PingCache`?
   **Answer**: The rate limiting mechanism in `PingCache` ensures that consecutive pings sent to a remote node are limited by the `rate_limit_delay` duration. The time-to-live (TTL) mechanism is used to determine the validity of received pong messages. If a pong message has expired (its age is greater than the TTL), it is removed from the cache. The cache also generates new ping messages to extend remote node verification if the pong message is not too recent (its age is greater than TTL / 8).
