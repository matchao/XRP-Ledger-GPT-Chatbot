The `push_active_set.rs` file is part of the Solana gossip protocol and is responsible for managing the active set of nodes to which gossip messages are pushed. The main data structure in this file is `PushActiveSet`, which contains an array of `PushActiveSetEntry` objects. Each entry corresponds to a stake bucket for the minimum stake of the current node and the CRDS value owner. The entry represents a set of gossip nodes to actively push to for CRDS values belonging to the bucket.

The `PushActiveSet` struct provides methods for getting nodes to push messages to, pruning origins for a given gossip node, and rotating the active set. The `get_nodes` method returns an iterator over the Pubkeys of gossip nodes to push messages to, based on the stake of the current node and the CRDS value owner. The `prune` method is used to stop pushing messages from specified origins to a given gossip node. The `rotate` method updates the active set by sampling gossip nodes based on their stake bucket and the stake bucket of the current node and the CRDS value owner.

The `PushActiveSetEntry` struct contains an `IndexMap` with gossip nodes as keys and their pruned origins as values. It provides methods for getting nodes to push messages to, pruning origins for a given gossip node, and rotating the active set entry. The `get_nodes` method returns an iterator over the Pubkeys of gossip nodes to push messages to, based on whether the node has pruned the origin or not. The `prune` method adds the origin to the bloom filter of the given gossip node. The `rotate` method updates the active set entry by sampling gossip nodes based on their weights and retaining a specified number of nodes.

The `get_stake_bucket` function maps stake to a bucket index, which is used to determine the stake bucket for a given node or CRDS value owner.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PushActiveSet` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `PushActiveSet` struct represents a set of gossip nodes to actively push to for CRDS values belonging to a specific stake bucket. It is used to manage the active set of nodes to push messages to, prune nodes based on their origins, and rotate the active set based on the stake bucket of each node.

2. **Question**: How does the `rotate` method work in the `PushActiveSet` struct?
   **Answer**: The `rotate` method updates the active set of nodes to push to by sampling from the provided gossip nodes using sampling probabilities obtained from the stake bucket of each node. It also updates the bloom filters for each entry in the active set.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `get_stake_bucket` function and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `get_stake_bucket` function maps a stake value to a bucket index. It is used to determine the stake bucket for a given stake value, which is then used to index into the `PushActiveSet` struct to get the corresponding active set entry.
