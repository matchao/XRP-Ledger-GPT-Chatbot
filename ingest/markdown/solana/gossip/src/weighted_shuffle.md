The `weighted_shuffle` module provides an iterator over shuffled indices based on their weights. The iterator returns unique indices in the range [0, weights.len()) where higher weighted indices tend to appear earlier proportional to their weight. Zero weighted indices are shuffled and appear only at the end, after non-zero weighted indices.

The `WeightedShuffle` struct is the main component of this module. It uses a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to maintain the cumulative sum of weights, excluding already selected indices. The struct has three fields: `arr` (the underlying array implementing the binary indexed tree), `sum` (the current sum of weights, excluding already selected indices), and `zeros` (indices of zero weighted entries).

The `WeightedShuffle` struct provides several methods:

- `new`: Creates a new `WeightedShuffle` instance from the given weights. Negative or overflowing weights are treated as zero.
- `cumsum`: Returns the cumulative sum of current weights up to a given index (inclusive).
- `remove`: Removes a given weight at a specified index.
- `search`: Returns the smallest index such that the cumulative sum of weights up to that index is greater than a given value, along with its respective weight.
- `remove_index`: Removes the weight at a specified index.
- `first`: Returns the first index in the shuffled sequence.
- `shuffle`: Returns an iterator over the shuffled indices.

The module also includes tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation, such as testing empty weights, zero weights, negative and overflowing weights, and matching the output with a slower implementation of weighted shuffle.

Here's an example of how to use the `WeightedShuffle` struct:

```rust
let weights = vec![1, 0, 1000, 0, 0, 10, 100, 0];
let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
let shuffle = WeightedShuffle::new("", &weights);
let shuffled_indices: Vec<usize> = shuffle.shuffle(&mut rng).collect();
```

In this example, the `shuffled_indices` vector will contain the indices of the `weights` vector shuffled according to their weights.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `WeightedShuffle` struct and how does it work?
   **Answer:** The `WeightedShuffle` struct provides an iterator over shuffled indices based on their weights. It returns unique indices in the range [0, weights.len()) where higher weighted indices tend to appear earlier proportional to their weight. Zero weighted indices are shuffled and appear only at the end, after non-zero weighted indices. It uses a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to maintain the cumulative sum of weights excluding already selected indices.

2. **Question:** How does the `WeightedShuffle::new` function handle negative or overflowing weights?
   **Answer:** The `WeightedShuffle::new` function treats negative or overflowing weights as zero. It also logs the number of negative and overflowing weights encountered using the `datapoint_error!` macro.

3. **Question:** How does the `WeightedShuffle::shuffle` function work and what does it return?
   **Answer:** The `WeightedShuffle::shuffle` function takes a mutable reference to a random number generator and returns an iterator that yields shuffled indices based on their weights. It uses the binary indexed tree to efficiently maintain the cumulative sum of weights and selects indices proportional to their weights.
