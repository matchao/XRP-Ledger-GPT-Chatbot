This code is part of the Solana project and provides macros for ensuring the stability of the ABI (Application Binary Interface) in Rust. The main purpose of this code is to generate implementations for the `AbiExample` and `AbiEnumVisitor` traits, which are used to test the ABI stability of structs and enums.

The `frozen_abi` macro attribute is used to specify the expected ABI digest for a given struct, enum, or type alias. When applied, it generates a test module that checks if the actual ABI digest matches the expected one. If the digests don't match, it suggests that the ABI might have changed, and the developer should investigate the differences.

The `derive_abi_sample` macro derives an implementation of the `AbiExample` trait for a given struct or enum. This trait provides an `example()` method that returns an instance of the type with sample values. This is used to generate sample instances for testing ABI stability.

The `derive_abi_enum_visitor` macro derives an implementation of the `AbiEnumVisitor` trait for a given enum. This trait provides a `visit_for_abi()` method that serializes each variant of the enum and updates the ABI digester with the serialized data. This is used to compute the ABI digest of the enum.

Here's an example of how these macros can be used:

```rust
#[frozen_abi(digest = "1234567890abcdef")]
#[derive(AbiExample, AbiEnumVisitor)]
pub enum MyEnum {
    Variant1,
    Variant2(u32),
    Variant3 { field: String },
}
```

In this example, the `frozen_abi` macro attribute is applied to `MyEnum`, specifying the expected ABI digest. The `derive_abi_sample` and `derive_abi_enum_visitor` macros are also applied, generating implementations of the `AbiExample` and `AbiEnumVisitor` traits for `MyEnum`. This allows the ABI stability of `MyEnum` to be tested against the expected digest.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `frozen_abi` attribute macro in this code?
   **Answer**: The `frozen_abi` attribute macro is used to ensure that the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of a struct, enum, or type alias remains consistent. It does this by generating a test that checks the ABI digest against an expected value provided in the macro attribute.

2. **Question**: How does the `derive_abi_sample` macro work for different types of items (structs, enums, etc.)?
   **Answer**: The `derive_abi_sample` macro generates an implementation of the `AbiExample` trait for the given item. It handles different types of items by pattern matching on the input item and calling the appropriate function (`derive_abi_sample_struct_type` for structs, `derive_abi_sample_enum_type` for enums) to generate the implementation code.

3. **Question**: What is the role of the `filter_serde_attrs` function in this code?
   **Answer**: The `filter_serde_attrs` function is used to check if a variant of an enum has the `serde(skip)` attribute. If the attribute is present, the function returns `true`, indicating that the variant should be skipped when generating the ABI digest.
