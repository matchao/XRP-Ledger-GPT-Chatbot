This code defines traits for displaying output in a quiet or verbose manner. It also exports the `cli_output` module for use in other parts of the project.

The `QuietDisplay` trait extends the standard library's `Display` trait and adds a `write_str` method that writes the object's string representation to a given writer. This trait is intended for use when output should be minimal and not include any unnecessary information.

The `VerboseDisplay` trait also extends the `Display` trait and adds a `write_str` method, but this method is intended for use when output should include additional information beyond just the object's string representation.

These traits can be used by other parts of the project to customize the output of various functions and methods. For example, a command-line interface may use the `QuietDisplay` trait to display only essential information to the user, while a debugging tool may use the `VerboseDisplay` trait to display more detailed information.

The `cli_output` module, which is also exported by this code, contains functions for formatting and displaying output in a consistent manner. This module can be used by other parts of the project to ensure that output is always displayed in a standardized way.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and customizable way to display output in the Solana project, allowing different parts of the project to display information in a way that is appropriate for their specific use case.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `QuietDisplay` and `VerboseDisplay` traits?
   - The `QuietDisplay` and `VerboseDisplay` traits are used to extend the functionality of the `std::fmt::Display` trait by adding a `write_str` method that writes the trait's contents to a mutable reference of `std::fmt::Write`.
2. Why is the `clippy::integer_arithmetic` lint allowed in this module?
   - The `clippy::integer_arithmetic` lint is allowed in this module to suppress warnings related to integer arithmetic, which may be necessary for certain operations within the code.
3. What is the purpose of the `cli_output` module and why is it being re-exported?
   - The `cli_output` module likely contains functionality related to outputting information to the command line interface. It is being re-exported to make its contents accessible to other modules without needing to import it directly.
