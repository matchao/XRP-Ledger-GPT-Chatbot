The `cli_version.rs` file contains the implementation of the `CliVersion` struct and its associated methods. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent and manipulate version numbers for the Solana command-line interface (CLI).

The `CliVersion` struct is defined as a newtype wrapper around an optional `semver::Version` instance. This allows for the possibility of an unknown version, represented by `None`. The struct derives several traits, including `Default`, `Debug`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Hash`, and `Clone`, which provide various methods and functionality for working with instances of the struct.

The `CliVersion` struct also provides several methods for working with instances of the struct. The `unknown_version` method returns a new instance of `CliVersion` with a value of `None`, representing an unknown version. The `fmt::Display` trait is implemented for `CliVersion`, allowing instances of the struct to be formatted as strings. If the value of the `CliVersion` instance is `None`, the string "unknown" is returned. Otherwise, the `to_string` method of the `semver::Version` instance is called to return the version number as a string.

The `From` and `FromStr` traits are implemented for `CliVersion`, allowing instances of the struct to be created from `semver::Version` instances and strings, respectively. The `From` implementation simply wraps the `semver::Version` instance in a new `CliVersion` instance. The `FromStr` implementation attempts to parse the input string as a `semver::Version` instance, returning an error if the parsing fails. If the input string is "unknown", a `CliVersion` instance with a value of `None` is returned.

Finally, the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits are implemented for `CliVersion`, allowing instances of the struct to be serialized and deserialized using the `serde` library. The `Serialize` implementation simply serializes the `CliVersion` instance as a string using the `to_string` method. The `Deserialize` implementation deserializes a string into a `CliVersion` instance by first deserializing the string into a `&str`, then calling the `FromStr` implementation to create the `CliVersion` instance.

Overall, the `CliVersion` struct and its associated methods provide a convenient and flexible way to represent and manipulate version numbers for the Solana CLI. For example, the `CliVersion` struct could be used to display the current version of the CLI to the user, or to compare the version of the CLI to a required minimum version.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CliVersion` struct?
    
    The `CliVersion` struct is used to represent the version of the CLI tool and can hold a `semver::Version` value.

2. What is the purpose of the `unknown_version` function?
    
    The `unknown_version` function returns a `CliVersion` instance with a `None` value, which represents an unknown version of the CLI tool.

3. What is the purpose of the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementations for `CliVersion`?
    
    The `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementations allow instances of `CliVersion` to be serialized and deserialized using serde, which is a popular Rust serialization and deserialization library.
