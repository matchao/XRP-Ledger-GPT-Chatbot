The `cluster.rs` file in the Solana project contains code that defines a `Cluster` trait and several related structs. The purpose of this code is to provide functionality for managing a cluster of Solana validators, which are nodes that participate in the Solana blockchain consensus process.

The `ValidatorInfo` struct contains information about a validator node, including its keypair, ledger path, and contact information. The `ClusterValidatorInfo` struct extends this by adding a `ValidatorConfig` and an optional `Validator` instance. The `Cluster` trait defines several methods for managing the cluster, including adding and removing nodes, restarting nodes, and retrieving information about nodes.

One important method is `get_validator_client`, which returns a `ThinClient` instance for a given validator node. This can be used to interact with the Solana blockchain from outside the cluster. Another important method is `exit_node`, which removes a node from the cluster and returns its `ClusterValidatorInfo`. This can be used to gracefully shut down a node or to move it to a different cluster.

The `restart_node` method restarts a node with the given `ClusterValidatorInfo` and `SocketAddrSpace`. The `create_restart_context` method creates a `Node` and `ContactInfo` for the restarted node, which can be used to connect to it. The `restart_node_with_context` method restarts a node with the given `ClusterValidatorInfo` and restart context.

The `add_node` method adds a node to the cluster with the given `ClusterValidatorInfo`. The `exit_restart_node` method removes a node from the cluster, restarts it with the given `ValidatorConfig` and `SocketAddrSpace`, and then adds it back to the cluster.

Overall, this code provides a way to manage a cluster of Solana validator nodes, including adding and removing nodes, restarting nodes, and retrieving information about nodes. This functionality is important for maintaining the health and stability of the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Cluster` trait?
    - The `Cluster` trait defines a set of methods that can be implemented by a type to interact with a Solana cluster, such as getting node pubkeys, getting validator clients, and adding or exiting nodes.

2. What is the `ValidatorInfo` struct used for?
    - The `ValidatorInfo` struct contains information about a validator node, including its keypair, voting keypair, ledger path, and contact information.

3. What is the `restart_node_with_context` method used for?
    - The `restart_node_with_context` method takes a `ClusterValidatorInfo` and a restart context, which includes a `Node` and an optional `ContactInfo`, and restarts the node with the given information and socket address space.
