The `local_cluster_snapshot_utils.rs` file contains code that provides utility functions for working with snapshot archives in a Solana local cluster. The `LocalCluster` struct is defined in this file and it has three methods: `wait_for_next_full_snapshot`, `wait_for_next_incremental_snapshot`, and `wait_for_next_snapshot`.

The `wait_for_next_full_snapshot` method waits for the next full snapshot archive to be generated after the cluster's last processed slot. It takes two arguments: `full_snapshot_archives_dir` and `max_wait_duration`. The `full_snapshot_archives_dir` argument is the directory where full snapshot archives are stored, and `max_wait_duration` is an optional argument that specifies the maximum duration to wait for the next snapshot archive to be generated. This method returns a `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct that contains information about the full snapshot archive.

The `wait_for_next_incremental_snapshot` method waits for the next incremental snapshot archive (and associated full snapshot archive) to be generated after the cluster's last processed slot. It takes three arguments: `full_snapshot_archives_dir`, `incremental_snapshot_archives_dir`, and `max_wait_duration`. The `full_snapshot_archives_dir` argument is the directory where full snapshot archives are stored, `incremental_snapshot_archives_dir` is the directory where incremental snapshot archives are stored, and `max_wait_duration` is an optional argument that specifies the maximum duration to wait for the next snapshot archive to be generated. This method returns a tuple containing an `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct and a `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct that contain information about the incremental and full snapshot archives, respectively.

The `wait_for_next_snapshot` method is a private method that is used by the other two methods to wait for the next snapshot archive to be generated. It takes four arguments: `full_snapshot_archives_dir`, `incremental_snapshot_archives_dir`, `next_snapshot_type`, and `max_wait_duration`. The `full_snapshot_archives_dir` argument is the directory where full snapshot archives are stored, `incremental_snapshot_archives_dir` is the directory where incremental snapshot archives are stored (optional), `next_snapshot_type` is an enum that specifies whether to wait for a full snapshot archive or both incremental and full snapshot archives, and `max_wait_duration` is an optional argument that specifies the maximum duration to wait for the next snapshot archive to be generated. This method returns a `NextSnapshotResult` enum that contains either a `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct or a tuple containing an `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct and a `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct.

Overall, these methods provide a convenient way to wait for snapshot archives to be generated in a Solana local cluster. They can be used to ensure that the cluster has the latest snapshot data before performing certain operations. For example, the `wait_for_next_full_snapshot` method could be used to wait for a full snapshot archive to be generated before running a validator node.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides utility functions for waiting and retrieving snapshot archive information for a Solana local cluster.

2. What are the input parameters for the `wait_for_next_full_snapshot` function?
    
    The `wait_for_next_full_snapshot` function takes in the `full_snapshot_archives_dir` parameter, which is the directory where full snapshot archives are stored, and an optional `max_wait_duration` parameter, which is the maximum duration to wait for the next snapshot archive.

3. What is the purpose of the `NextSnapshotResult` enum?
    
    The `NextSnapshotResult` enum is used to represent the result of waiting for the next snapshot archive, which can either be a full snapshot archive or an incremental snapshot archive along with its associated full snapshot archive.
