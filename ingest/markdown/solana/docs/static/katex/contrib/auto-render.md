The `auto-render.mjs` file is a module that exports a function called `renderMathInElement`. This function takes an HTML element and an options object as arguments and renders any LaTeX math expressions within the element using KaTeX. The purpose of this module is to automate the rendering of math expressions in HTML documents without the need for manual markup.

The `renderMathInElement` function first checks if an element is provided and throws an error if not. It then creates a copy of the options object and sets default values for any missing options. These options include the delimiters used to identify math expressions, ignored tags and classes, and an error callback function.

The `renderElem` function is then called with the element and options copy as arguments. This function recursively traverses the element's child nodes and renders any math expressions found using the `renderMathInText` function. If a child node is a text node, `renderMathInText` is called with the text content and options copy. If the result is not null, the text node is replaced with a document fragment containing the rendered math expression. If a child node is an element node, `renderElem` is called recursively with the child node and options copy as arguments. If the element node is not ignored based on the options, its child nodes are traversed and rendered as before.

The `renderMathInText` function splits the input text into an array of objects representing either text or math expressions. It does this by repeatedly searching for the left and right delimiters and alternating between text and math objects. The math objects contain the raw data, the processed data, and a flag indicating whether the expression should be displayed in display mode. The processed data is rendered using KaTeX and appended to a document fragment along with any text objects. The resulting fragment is returned.

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to automatically render math expressions in HTML documents using KaTeX. It can be used in the larger project to improve the accessibility and readability of math content. For example, it can be used to render math expressions in blog posts, textbooks, or scientific articles. Here is an example usage of the `renderMathInElement` function:

```javascript
import renderMathInElement from 'solana/docs/static/katex/contrib/auto-render.mjs';

const element = document.getElementById('math-content');
const options = {
  delimiters: [
    { left: '$$', right: '$$', display: true },
    { left: '\\(', right: '\\)', display: false },
    { left: '\\[', right: '\\]', display: true }
  ],
  ignoredTags: ['script', 'style'],
  ignoredClasses: ['no-math'],
  errorCallback: console.warn
};

renderMathInElement(element, options);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a module that exports a function called `renderMathInElement` which renders LaTeX math expressions in an HTML element.

2. What external library does this code depend on?
- This code depends on the `katex` library which is imported at the beginning of the file.

3. What are the default delimiters used by `renderMathInElement`?
- The default delimiters used by `renderMathInElement` are `$$...$$` for display mode, `\(...\)` for inline mode, and `\[...\]` for display mode.
