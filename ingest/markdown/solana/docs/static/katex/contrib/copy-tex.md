The `copy-tex.mjs` file contains code that modifies the behavior of the copy action in the browser for web pages that use the KaTeX library for rendering mathematical expressions. The purpose of the code is to replace the default copy behavior with one that copies the TeX source of the mathematical expressions instead of the rendered output. This is useful for users who want to copy mathematical expressions from a web page and paste them into a document or text editor while preserving the original TeX source.

The code achieves this by listening for the `copy` event on the `document` object. When the event is triggered, the code checks if the selection made by the user contains any KaTeX elements with the class `katex-mathml`. If there are no such elements, the default copy behavior is preserved. Otherwise, the code clones the contents of the selection and modifies the cloned fragment in place to replace the KaTeX elements with their TeX source. The modified fragment is then used to set the data for the clipboard in both HTML and plain text formats.

The `katexReplaceWithTex` function is the main function that modifies the fragment. It takes two arguments: the fragment to modify and an optional object that specifies the delimiters to use for inline and display math. If no delimiters are specified, the default ones are used. The function first removes any `.katex-html` elements that are preceded by `.katex-mathml` elements, since these are duplicates of the rendered output that will be replaced. It then replaces each `.katex-mathml` element with its TeX source, wrapped in the specified inline delimiters. Finally, it replaces any `.katex-display` elements with their TeX source, wrapped in the specified display delimiters.

Overall, this code is a useful addition to the KaTeX library that enhances the user experience by providing a more flexible and customizable copy behavior for mathematical expressions. Here is an example of how the code might be used in a web page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Copy KaTeX</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.11.1/katex.min.css">
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.11.1/katex.min.js"></script>
  <script src="copy-tex.mjs" type="module"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Here is an example of a mathematical expression: $$\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}.$$</p>
  <p>Select the expression and copy it to see the TeX source.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `katexReplaceWithTex` function?
    
    The `katexReplaceWithTex` function replaces `.katex-mathml` elements with their annotation (TeX source) descendant, with inline and display delimiters, and modifies the fragment in-place.

2. What is the purpose of the `document.addEventListener('copy', ...)` block?
    
    The `document.addEventListener('copy', ...)` block listens for a copy event and modifies the copied text to include TeX source with inline and display delimiters for any `.katex-mathml` elements in the copied content.

3. What is the purpose of the `defaultCopyDelimiters` object?
    
    The `defaultCopyDelimiters` object sets the default delimiters for inline and display math when copying TeX source, and provides alternative delimiters as comments.
