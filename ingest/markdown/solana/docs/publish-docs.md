The `publish-docs.sh` script is used to deploy the Solana documentation website to the Vercel hosting platform. The script first checks if a `.vercel` directory exists and removes it if it does. This directory is used by Vercel to store build artifacts and configuration files.

Next, the script sets the `CONFIG_FILE` variable to `vercel.json`. This file is used to configure the Vercel deployment and contains information such as the project name, scope, and redirects. The project name is determined based on the environment in which the script is being run. If the `$CI_TAG` environment variable is set, the project name is set to `docs-solana-com`. Otherwise, the script runs the `channel-info.sh` script to determine the current Solana release channel and sets the project name accordingly. The project name is used to determine the URL of the deployed website.

The script then generates the `vercel.json` file by using a `cat` command to write a JSON object to the file. The object contains the project name, scope, and an array of redirects. The redirects are used to map old URLs to new URLs on the deployed website. For example, the redirect `{ "source": "/apps", "destination": "/developers" }` maps the `/apps` URL to the `/developers` URL.

Finally, the script checks if the `VERCEL_TOKEN` environment variable is set and exits with an error if it is not. The `VERCEL_TOKEN` is a secret token used to authenticate with the Vercel API. If the token is set, the script deploys the website to Vercel using the `vercel` command-line tool. The `--local-config` flag is used to specify the `vercel.json` file, the `--confirm` flag is used to skip the confirmation prompt, and the `--token` flag is used to specify the `VERCEL_TOKEN`.

This script is an important part of the Solana documentation website deployment process. It allows Solana developers to easily deploy changes to the website and ensure that old URLs are properly redirected to new URLs. Here is an example usage of the script:

```
$ export VERCEL_TOKEN=<your_vercel_token>
$ ./publish-docs.sh
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to deploy the Solana documentation website to Vercel.

2. What is the significance of the `PROJECT_NAME` variable?
   
   The `PROJECT_NAME` variable is used to specify the name of the project that will be deployed to Vercel. Its value is determined based on the value of the `$CI_TAG` environment variable or the `$CHANNEL` environment variable.

3. What is the purpose of the `redirects` array in the `vercel.json` file?
   
   The `redirects` array is used to specify URL redirects for the Solana documentation website. It maps old URLs to new URLs to ensure that users are redirected to the correct page even if the URL has changed.
