This code is a custom CSS file that defines the global styles for the Solana project documentation. It is designed to work well for content-centric websites and uses the Infima CSS framework by default.

The code starts by importing the Roboto font from Google Fonts and then sets various color, font, and spacing variables for the project. These variables are used throughout the rest of the CSS to maintain a consistent look and feel.

The `@keyframes fadeInUp` animation is defined, which is used later in the `.card` class to create a fade-in effect for cards. The `main` element has its margin adjusted to provide better spacing on the page.

The `.docusaurus-highlight-code-line` class is used to style code blocks, giving them a specific background color and padding. The `.button` class is used to style buttons with a specific background color, font size, and padding.

The `.container__spacer`, `.cards__container`, and `.col` classes are used to adjust the spacing and margins for various elements within the documentation. The `.card` class is used to style cards with specific padding, animation, and border styles. The `:hover` state for cards is also defined, changing the border color when the user hovers over a card.

The `.footer--dark` class is used to style the dark theme footer with a specific background color. The `footer .text--center` class adjusts the padding for centered text within the footer.

The `.card__header h3` class is used to style the header text within cards, giving it a specific color. The `.header-link-icon` and related classes are used to style header icons for GitHub and Discord with specific background images and padding.

Overall, this custom CSS file helps create a consistent and visually appealing design for the Solana project documentation.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `:root` block in this CSS file?
   **Answer**: The `:root` block is used to define global CSS variables that can be used throughout the stylesheet. It sets values for various colors, font sizes, spacing, and font families that can be easily referenced and modified in one place.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `@keyframes fadeInUp` block in this CSS file?
   **Answer**: The `@keyframes fadeInUp` block defines an animation that can be applied to elements. However, in this case, the actual animation steps are commented out, so the animation will not have any effect. If uncommented, it would create a fade-in effect combined with a slight upward movement.

3. **Question**: How are the `.header-github-link:before` and `[data-theme="dark"] .header-github-link:before` selectors being used in this CSS file?
   **Answer**: The `.header-github-link:before` selector is used to style the GitHub link in the header by adding a GitHub icon as a background image. The `[data-theme="dark"] .header-github-link:before` selector is used to apply a different version of the GitHub icon when the theme is set to "dark", ensuring that the icon is visible against the dark background.
