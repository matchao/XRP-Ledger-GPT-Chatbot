The `autodoc/solana/docs/src/proposals` folder contains documentation for various proposals related to the Solana project. These proposals outline new features, improvements, or changes to the existing codebase, and they serve as a reference for developers working on the project. The documentation in this folder helps to ensure that all team members have a clear understanding of the proposed changes and their implications.

Here's a brief overview of the files and subfolders in this folder:

### Files

1. **`README.md`**: This file provides an introduction to the proposals folder and its contents. It also includes guidelines for creating new proposals and submitting them for review.

2. **`template.md`**: This file serves as a template for creating new proposals. It outlines the structure and format that should be followed when writing a proposal, including sections for the proposal's title, summary, motivation, proposed solution, and more.

### Subfolders

1. **`completed`**: This subfolder contains proposals that have been completed and implemented in the Solana codebase. These proposals serve as a historical record of the project's evolution and can be used as a reference for future proposals or development work.

2. **`in-progress`**: This subfolder contains proposals that are currently being worked on or are under review. Developers can use these proposals to stay up-to-date on the latest changes and discussions related to the project.

3. **`rejected`**: This subfolder contains proposals that have been rejected or withdrawn. These proposals can still be useful for understanding the project's history and the reasons behind certain decisions.

For example, if a developer wants to propose a new feature or improvement to the Solana codebase, they would start by creating a new proposal document using the `template.md` file as a guide. They would then fill in the necessary information, such as the proposal's title, summary, motivation, and proposed solution. Once the proposal is complete, they would submit it for review by adding it to the `in-progress` subfolder.

Other developers working on the project can then review the proposal, provide feedback, and discuss potential changes or improvements. Once a consensus has been reached and the proposal has been approved, it can be moved to the `completed` subfolder and the proposed changes can be implemented in the codebase.

In summary, the `autodoc/solana/docs/src/proposals` folder plays a crucial role in the development process of the Solana project. It helps to ensure that all team members are on the same page regarding proposed changes and improvements, and it provides a clear and organized way to document and track the project's evolution.
