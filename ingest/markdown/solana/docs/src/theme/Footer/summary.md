The `Footer` component in `index.js` is responsible for rendering the footer section of the Solana project's documentation website. It utilizes the `useDocusaurusContext` hook to access the site configuration and the `useBaseUrl` hook to generate URLs based on the site's base URL. The component extracts the `footer` object from the `themeConfig` object, which contains information about the footer, such as the copyright notice, links to other pages, and a logo.

The component first checks if the `footer` object is defined; if not, it returns `null`. If the object is defined, it renders the footer using Bootstrap's `container` and `row` classes. The links in the footer are rendered using the `links` array in the `footer` object, with each link being a `div` element with a `col` class. The `FooterLink` component is used to render a list of links if the link has an `items` property.

The `Footer` component also renders the logo and copyright notice using the `logo` and `copyright` properties in the `footer` object. If the `logo` property is defined, it is rendered as an `img` element with an `alt` attribute and a `src` attribute generated using the `useBaseUrl` hook. If the `logo` property has an `href` property, the logo is wrapped in an `a` element with the `href` attribute set to the `href` property.

The `styles.module.css` file defines the styling for the footer logo link. The `.footerLogoLink` class sets the opacity of the link to 0.5 and applies a transition effect of 0.15 seconds when the opacity changes. The `:hover` pseudo-class is used to change the opacity to 1 when the user hovers over the link. This styling enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback when interacting with the footer logo link.

Example usage:

```jsx
import Footer from './Footer';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <main>Content</main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Footer` component is imported and used in the `App` component to render the footer section of the website. The `Footer` component will use the site configuration to generate the appropriate links, logo, and copyright notice, providing a consistent look and feel across the site.
