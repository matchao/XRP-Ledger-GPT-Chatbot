This code defines the styling for the footer logo link in the Solana project's documentation website. The `.footerLogoLink` class sets the opacity of the link to 0.5 and applies a transition effect of 0.15 seconds when the opacity changes. The `:hover` pseudo-class is used to change the opacity to 1 when the user hovers over the link.

This styling is important for the user experience of the documentation website as it provides visual feedback to the user when they interact with the footer logo link. The transition effect creates a smooth animation when the opacity changes, making the interaction feel more natural and intuitive.

This code can be used as an example of how to define CSS styles for links in a website. Developers working on the Solana project can use this code as a reference when styling other links in the documentation website or in other parts of the project.

Example usage:

```html
<footer>
  <a href="#" class="footerLogoLink">Solana</a>
</footer>
```

```css
.footerLogoLink {
  opacity: 0.5;
  transition: opacity 0.15s ease-in-out;
}

.footerLogoLink:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
```
