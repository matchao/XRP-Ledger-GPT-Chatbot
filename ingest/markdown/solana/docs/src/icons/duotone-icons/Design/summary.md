The `Design` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a collection of SVG files that represent various design-related icons. These icons are designed with a duotone style, meaning they use two colors to create a visually appealing and modern look. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience.

Here's a summary of the files in this folder:

1. `align-center.svg`: An icon representing the alignment of content to the center.
2. `align-left.svg`: An icon representing the alignment of content to the left.
3. `align-right.svg`: An icon representing the alignment of content to the right.
4. `bold.svg`: An icon representing bold text formatting.
5. `italic.svg`: An icon representing italic text formatting.
6. `underline.svg`: An icon representing underlined text formatting.

These icons can be used in various parts of the Solana project, such as in the user interface of the Solana web app, the Solana wallet, or any other Solana-related applications. They can be used to represent different design-related actions or settings that users can interact with.

For example, if the Solana project has a text editor component, these icons can be used in the toolbar to allow users to format their text. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to use these icons in an HTML file:

```html
<button class="toolbar-button"
