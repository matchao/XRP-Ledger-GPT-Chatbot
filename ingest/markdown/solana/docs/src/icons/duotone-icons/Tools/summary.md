The `Tools` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG files representing various tools-related icons. These icons are designed with a duotone style, which means they use two colors to create a visually appealing and easily recognizable representation of the tool. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience.

Here's a summary of the files in this folder:

1. `hammer.svg`: An icon representing a hammer, which could be used to symbolize construction, building, or manual work.
2. `screwdriver.svg`: An icon representing a screwdriver, which could be used to symbolize repair, maintenance, or assembly tasks.
3. `wrench.svg`: An icon representing a wrench, which could be used to symbolize adjusting, tightening, or loosening operations.

These icons can be easily integrated into the Solana project by importing the SVG files and using them as components in the user interface. For example, they can be used as buttons, menu items, or visual indicators to help users navigate the application and understand the functionality of different features.

Here's an example of how to use the `hammer.svg` icon in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ReactComponent as HammerIcon } from './icons/duotone-icons/Tools/hammer.svg';

const HammerButton = ({ onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>
    <HammerIcon />
  </button>
);

export default HammerButton;
```

In this example, the `HammerIcon` component is imported from the `hammer.svg` file and used as a child element within a `button` element. The `HammerButton` component can then be used throughout the Solana project to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

Similarly, the other icons in the `Tools` folder can be used in the same way to create a cohesive and professional-looking interface for the Solana project. By using these duotone icons, developers can ensure that the project's visual design is consistent and easily recognizable, making it more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.
