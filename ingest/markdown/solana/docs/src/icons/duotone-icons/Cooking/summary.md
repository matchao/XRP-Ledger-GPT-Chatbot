The `Cooking` folder in the `autodoc/solana/docs/src/icons/duotone-icons` directory contains a set of duotone icons related to cooking. These icons are designed to be used throughout the Solana project to represent various cooking-related concepts and actions. Duotone icons are a type of vector graphic that use two colors to create a simple, yet visually appealing design.

### Files in the Cooking folder

Here's a brief overview of the files in the `Cooking` folder:

1. `chef-hat.svg`: This file contains the vector graphic for a chef's hat icon. It can be used to represent a chef or a cooking-related action in the user interface.
2. `cutlery.svg`: This file contains the vector graphic for a set of cutlery, including a fork, knife, and spoon. It can be used to represent eating or food preparation in the user interface.
3. `frying-pan.svg`: This file contains the vector graphic for a frying pan icon. It can be used to represent cooking or food preparation in the user interface.
4. `kitchen-knife.svg`: This file contains the vector graphic for a kitchen knife icon. It can be used to represent cutting or food preparation in the user interface.
5. `rolling-pin.svg`: This file contains the vector graphic for a rolling pin icon. It can be used to represent baking or food preparation in the user interface.

### Usage

These icons can be used in various parts of the Solana project where cooking-related concepts or actions need to be represented. For example, they can be used in the user interface of a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana platform that focuses on food or cooking.

To use one of these icons in your project, you can simply import the SVG file and include it in your HTML or JSX code. Here's an example of how to use the `chef-hat.svg` icon in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChefHatIcon from './icons/duotone-icons/Cooking/chef-hat.svg';

const CookingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Cooking dApp!</h1>
      <img src={ChefHatIcon} alt="Chef Hat Icon" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CookingComponent;
```

In this example, the `chef-hat.svg` icon is imported and used as the source for an `<img>` element in a React component. This will display the chef's hat icon in the user interface of the dApp.

Overall, the `Cooking` folder provides a set of duotone icons that can be used to enhance the visual design of the Solana project or any dApps built on the platform. By using these icons, developers can create a more engaging and visually appealing user experience for their applications.
