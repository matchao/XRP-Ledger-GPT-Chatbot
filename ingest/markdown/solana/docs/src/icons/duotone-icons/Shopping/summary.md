The `Shopping` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG files representing shopping-related icons. These icons are designed with a duotone style, meaning they use two colors to create a visually appealing and easily recognizable representation of various shopping concepts. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience.

Here is a list of the files in this folder and a summary of the contents of each file:

1. `cart.svg`: This file contains an SVG representation of a shopping cart. It can be used to indicate a shopping cart feature or a place where users can view and manage their selected items.

2. `credit-card.svg`: This file contains an SVG representation of a credit card. It can be used to indicate payment options or to represent the concept of online payments within the application.

3. `gift.svg`: This file contains an SVG representation of a gift box. It can be used to represent promotions, special offers, or gift-related features within the application.

4. `price-tag.svg`: This file contains an SVG representation of a price tag. It can be used to represent pricing information or discounts on products and services.

5. `store.svg`: This file contains an SVG representation of a store or shop. It can be used to represent a marketplace, a list of available products, or a section where users can browse and purchase items.

These icons can be easily integrated into the Solana project by importing the SVG files and using them as components in the user interface. For example, the `cart.svg` icon can be used in a navigation bar to indicate the shopping cart feature:

```html
<!-- Import the cart.svg file -->
<img src="path/to/autodoc/solana/docs/src/icons/duotone-icons/Shopping/cart.svg" alt="Shopping Cart" />

<!-- Use the icon in a navigation bar -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/products">Products</a></li>
    <li><a href="/cart"><img src="path/to/cart.svg" alt="Shopping Cart" /></a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

By using these icons, developers can create a consistent and visually appealing user interface that enhances the overall user experience. The duotone style of these icons also ensures that they will blend well with various color schemes and design styles, making them a versatile addition to the Solana project.
