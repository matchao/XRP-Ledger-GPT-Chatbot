The `Files` folder in the `duotone-icons` directory contains a collection of SVG files representing various file-related icons. These icons are designed with a duotone style, which means they use two colors to create a visually appealing and modern look. These icons can be used throughout the Solana project to represent different file types, actions, or statuses in the user interface.

Here is a list of the files in this folder and a summary of the contents of each file:

1. `file-add.svg`: An icon representing the action of adding a new file.
2. `file-check.svg`: An icon representing a file that has been verified or approved.
3. `file-code.svg`: An icon representing a code file, typically used for programming or scripting files.
4. `file-download.svg`: An icon representing the action of downloading a file.
5. `file-edit.svg`: An icon representing the action of editing a file.
6. `file-minus.svg`: An icon representing the action of removing a file.
7. `file-music.svg`: An icon representing a music or audio file.
8. `file-picture.svg`: An icon representing an image or picture file.
9. `file-play.svg`: An icon representing a video or media file.
10. `file-search.svg`: An icon representing the action of searching for a file.
11. `file-upload.svg`: An icon representing the action of uploading a file.

These icons can be easily integrated into the Solana project by importing the SVG files and using them as components in the user interface. For example, if you want to use the `file-add.svg` icon in a button that allows users to add new files, you can include the SVG file in your project and use it as a source for an image element:

```html
<button>
  <img src="path/to/autodoc/solana/docs/src/icons/duotone-icons/Files/file-add.svg" alt="Add File" />
  Add File
</button>
```

Similarly, you can use other icons from this folder to represent different actions or file types in your project. By using these duotone icons, you can maintain a consistent and modern visual style throughout the Solana project's user interface.

In summary, the `Files` folder in the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of file-related icons designed with a duotone style. These icons can be used in various parts of the Solana project to represent different file types, actions, or statuses, helping to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
