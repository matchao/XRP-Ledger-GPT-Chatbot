The `General` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a collection of general-purpose icons that are used throughout the Solana project. These icons are designed in a duotone style, which means they consist of two colors, typically a primary color and a secondary color. This design choice allows for a consistent and visually appealing user interface across the entire project.

The icons in this folder are in SVG format, which is a scalable vector graphics format that allows for high-quality rendering at any size without loss of detail. This makes them suitable for use in various parts of the project, such as the user interface, documentation, and marketing materials.

Here is a list of the files in this folder and a summary of the contents of each file:

1. `arrow-circle-left.svg`: An icon representing a left-pointing arrow within a circle.
2. `arrow-circle-right.svg`: An icon representing a right-pointing arrow within a circle.
3. `check-circle.svg`: An icon representing a checkmark within a circle, typically used to indicate success or completion.
4. `exclamation-circle.svg`: An icon representing an exclamation mark within a circle, typically used to indicate a warning or important information.
5. `info-circle.svg`: An icon representing an "i" (information) symbol within a circle, typically used to provide additional information or context.
6. `minus-circle.svg`: An icon representing a minus sign within a circle, typically used to indicate subtraction or removal.
7. `plus-circle.svg`: An icon representing a plus sign within a circle, typically used to indicate addition or creation.
8. `question-circle.svg`: An icon representing a question mark within a circle, typically used to indicate help or support.
9. `times-circle.svg`: An icon representing a multiplication sign (X) within a circle, typically used to indicate closure or cancellation.

These icons can be easily integrated into the Solana project by including the appropriate SVG file in the desired location. For example, to use the `check-circle.svg` icon in an HTML file, you would include the following code:

```html
<img src="path/to/icons/duotone-icons/General/check-circle.svg" alt="Success" />
```

In addition to the individual SVG files, the `General` folder may also contain a stylesheet or JavaScript file to help with styling and interaction of the icons. This can be useful for applying consistent styles across all icons in the project or for adding interactivity, such as changing the icon color on hover or click events.

In summary, the `General` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory provides a collection of general-purpose, duotone SVG icons that can be used throughout the Solana project to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
