The `Navigation` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG icons specifically designed for navigation purposes in the Solana project. These icons are created using a duotone style, which means they consist of two colors, making them visually appealing and easy to integrate into various parts of the project.

Here's a brief overview of the files in this folder:

1. `arrow-left.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for an arrow pointing to the left. It can be used for navigating back or indicating a previous step in a process.
2. `arrow-right.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for an arrow pointing to the right. It can be used for navigating forward or indicating the next step in a process.
3. `chevron-down.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for a chevron pointing downwards. It can be used for expanding a dropdown menu or revealing hidden content.
4. `chevron-up.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for a chevron pointing upwards. It can be used for collapsing a dropdown menu or hiding content.
5. `home.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for a home icon. It can be used for navigating to the main page or dashboard of the application.
6. `menu.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for a menu icon, typically represented by three horizontal lines. It can be used for toggling a navigation menu or accessing additional options.

These icons can be easily integrated into the Solana project by importing the SVG files and using them as components in the application. For example, you might use the `arrow-left.svg` and `arrow-right.svg` icons to create a pagination component:

```html
<button>
  <img src="arrow-left.svg" alt="Previous Page" />
</button>
<button>
  <img src="arrow-right.svg" alt="Next Page" />
</button>
```

Or you could use the `chevron-down.svg` and `chevron-up.svg` icons to create an expandable menu:

```html
<button>
  <img src="chevron-down.svg" alt="Expand Menu" />
</button>
<button>
  <img src="chevron-up.svg" alt="Collapse Menu" />
</button>
```

In summary, the `Navigation` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory provides a set of visually appealing and easy-to-use SVG icons specifically designed for navigation purposes. These icons can be easily integrated into various parts of the Solana project, enhancing the user experience and providing a consistent visual style.
