The `Electric` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory contains a set of SVG icons specifically designed for the Solana project. These icons follow a duotone style, which means they use two colors to create a visually appealing and modern design. The icons in this folder are related to the theme of electricity, which could be used to represent various aspects of the Solana project, such as energy efficiency, speed, or power.

Here is a summary of the files in the `Electric` folder:

1. `bolt.svg`: This file contains an SVG icon of a lightning bolt, which can be used to represent power, energy, or speed in the Solana project. For example, it could be used to indicate the high-performance capabilities of the Solana blockchain.

2. `plug.svg`: This file contains an SVG icon of an electrical plug, which can be used to represent connectivity or integration with other systems in the Solana project. For example, it could be used to show that Solana can easily connect with other blockchains or external data sources.

3. `power.svg`: This file contains an SVG icon of a power button, which can be used to represent the activation or deactivation of certain features in the Solana project. For example, it could be used to show that a user can enable or disable specific functionalities within the Solana ecosystem.

To use these icons in your project, you can simply include the SVG code in your HTML or JSX file. For example, to use the `bolt.svg` icon, you can include the following code in your project:

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path d="M13 2L11.5 6H15L9 22L10.5 18H7L13 2Z" />
</svg>
```

These icons can be customized by modifying the SVG code or by applying CSS styles to change their appearance, such as color, size, or opacity. For example, to change the color of the `bolt.svg` icon to blue, you can add a `fill` attribute to the `path` element:

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path fill="blue" d="M13 2L11.5 6H15L9 22L10.5 18H7L13 2Z" />
</svg>
```

In summary, the `Electric` folder within the `duotone-icons` directory provides a set of electricity-themed SVG icons that can be used to enhance the visual design of the Solana project. These icons can be easily integrated into the project and customized to fit the desired appearance and style.
