The `autodoc/solana/docs/src/icons/social` folder contains a collection of icons related to social media platforms and other communication channels. These icons are used throughout the Solana documentation to provide users with quick access to relevant social media platforms and communication channels, such as Twitter, Discord, and GitHub.

Here is a list of the files in this folder and a summary of the contents of each file:

1. `discord.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for the Discord icon. It can be used to link to the Solana Discord server or any other relevant Discord channels.
2. `github.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for the GitHub icon. It can be used to link to the Solana GitHub repository or any other relevant GitHub repositories.
3. `medium.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for the Medium icon. It can be used to link to the Solana Medium blog or any other relevant Medium articles.
4. `reddit.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for the Reddit icon. It can be used to link to the Solana subreddit or any other relevant Reddit communities.
5. `telegram.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for the Telegram icon. It can be used to link to the Solana Telegram group or any other relevant Telegram channels.
6. `twitter.svg`: This file contains the SVG code for the Twitter icon. It can be used to link to the Solana Twitter account or any other relevant Twitter profiles.

These icons can be easily integrated into the Solana documentation by importing the SVG files and using them as components. For example, to include the Twitter icon and link it to the Solana Twitter account, you can use the following code snippet:

```jsx
import TwitterIcon from './icons/social/twitter.svg';

function SocialLinks() {
  return (
    <a href="https://twitter.com/solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <TwitterIcon />
    </a>
  );
}
```

This code imports the `twitter.svg` file as a React component and wraps it in an anchor tag that links to the Solana Twitter account. The `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes ensure that the link opens in a new tab and maintains the security of the parent page.

In summary, the `autodoc/solana/docs/src/icons/social` folder contains a set of social media icons that can be used throughout the Solana documentation to provide users with quick access to relevant social media platforms and communication channels. These icons are implemented as SVG files, making them easy to integrate into the documentation as React components.
