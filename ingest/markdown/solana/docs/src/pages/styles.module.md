This file contains CSS code that is used to style various components of the Solana project's documentation website. The code is written in CSS module format, which means that it is scoped locally to the components that it styles. 

The `.heroBanner` class is used to style the hero banner section of the website. It sets the padding, text alignment, and overflow properties of the section, and positions it relative to its parent element. Additionally, there is a media query that adjusts the padding of the section for smaller screens.

The `.cardTitle` class is used to style the titles of cards on the website. It sets the color of the text to green.

The `.buttons` class is used to style button elements on the website. It sets the display, align-items, and justify-content properties of the buttons to center them horizontally and vertically within their parent element.

The `.features` class is used to style a section of the website that displays a list of features. It sets the display and align-items properties of the section to display its child elements as a flex container and align them to the top of the container. It also sets the padding and width properties of the section.

The `.featureImage` class is used to style images that are displayed alongside the features on the website. It sets the height and width properties of the images to 200 pixels.

Finally, the `.iconExternalIcon` class is used to style an external icon that is displayed next to links on the website. It sets the margin-left property of the icon to 0.5em.

Overall, this CSS code is used to style various components of the Solana project's documentation website, making it more visually appealing and easier to navigate for users. Developers working on the project can use these classes to ensure consistency in the styling of different components across the website. For example, they can apply the `.heroBanner` class to the hero banner section of any new pages they create, and it will automatically inherit the styling properties defined in this file.
