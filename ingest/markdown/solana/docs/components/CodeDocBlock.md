The `CodeDocBlock.jsx` file contains a set of React components that are used to display code documentation in a consistent and visually appealing way. The components are designed to be used in conjunction with other components in the Solana project to provide a unified documentation experience.

The `DocBlock` component is a simple wrapper that takes in a set of child components and applies a consistent style to them. This component is used to group related documentation elements together, such as a set of parameters or a code snippet.

The `DocSideBySide` component is similar to `DocBlock`, but is designed to display two sets of child components side-by-side. This is useful for displaying before-and-after code examples, or for comparing two different code snippets.

The `CodeParams` component is used to display a set of parameters for a function or method. It takes in a set of child components, which are typically instances of the `Parameter` component.

The `CodeSnippets` component is used to display one or more code snippets. It takes in a set of child components, which are typically instances of the `CodeSnippet` component.

The `Parameter` component is used to display a single parameter for a function or method. It takes in a set of props that describe the parameter, such as its name, type, and whether it is required or optional. The component also takes in a set of child components, which are typically instances of the `Field` component.

The `Field` component is used to display a single field of a parameter. It takes in a set of props that describe the field, such as its name, type, and default value. The component also takes in a set of child components, which are typically instances of the `Values` component.

The `Values` component is used to display an array of string values. It takes in a single prop, `values`, which is an array of strings. The component formats the values as a series of code blocks, with each value separated by a space.

The `computeHeader` function is a helper function that takes in a set of props and computes the formatted header metadata for the `Parameter` and `Field` components. It formats the name, type, values, required flag, optional flag, and default value flag, and returns them as an object. This function is used internally by the `Parameter` and `Field` components to format their headers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines several React components used for displaying code documentation blocks.

2. What external dependencies does this code file use?
- This code file imports the React library and the Link component from the "@docusaurus/Link" package.

3. What is the purpose of the `computeHeader` function?
- The `computeHeader` function is used to format and extract metadata from the props passed to the `Parameter` and `Field` components, such as the parameter name, type, values, and flags like "required" or "optional".
