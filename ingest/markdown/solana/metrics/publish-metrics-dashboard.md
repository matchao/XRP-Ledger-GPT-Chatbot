The `publish-metrics-dashboard.sh` script is used to publish a Grafana dashboard to a specified channel. The script takes one argument, which is the channel to publish the dashboard to. The channel can be one of `edge`, `beta`, or `stable`. The purpose of this script is to automate the process of publishing a dashboard to different channels, which is useful for testing and releasing new versions of the dashboard.

The script first checks if the channel argument is provided. If not, it prints an error message and exits. Then, it sets the `DASHBOARD` variable based on the channel argument. The `DASHBOARD` variable is used to specify the name of the dashboard to publish. The script also checks if the `GRAFANA_API_TOKEN` environment variable is defined. This variable is used to authenticate with the Grafana API.

Next, the script checks if the dashboard JSON file exists and is readable. If not, it prints an error message and exits. Then, it runs a Python script called `adjust-dashboard-for-channel.py` to modify the dashboard JSON file based on the channel argument. This script replaces some placeholders in the JSON file with actual values, such as the name of the dashboard and the URL of the data source.

After that, the script creates a Python virtual environment and installs the `grafcli` package, which is a command-line tool for interacting with the Grafana API. The `grafcli` tool is used to export, import, and delete dashboards.

Then, the script takes a backup of the existing dashboard by exporting it to a file with the `.org` extension. If the export fails, the script ignores the error and continues. Then, it deletes the existing dashboard using the `grafcli rm` command. Finally, it publishes the modified dashboard JSON file to the specified channel using the `grafcli import` command.

In summary, the `publish-metrics-dashboard.sh` script automates the process of publishing a Grafana dashboard to a specified channel. It modifies the dashboard JSON file based on the channel argument, creates a Python virtual environment, installs the `grafcli` package, takes a backup of the existing dashboard, deletes the existing dashboard, and publishes the modified dashboard JSON file to the specified channel. This script is useful for testing and releasing new versions of the dashboard.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script is used to publish a metrics dashboard to Grafana based on the specified channel (edge, beta, or stable).

2. What is the significance of the `GRAFANA_API_TOKEN` variable?
   - The `GRAFANA_API_TOKEN` variable is used to authenticate the user's access to the Grafana API. If it is not defined, the script will exit with an error.

3. What is the `adjust-dashboard-for-channel.py` script doing?
   - The `adjust-dashboard-for-channel.py` script is used to modify the dashboard JSON file based on the specified channel. It takes the original dashboard JSON file and creates a new one with the appropriate modifications for the specified channel.
