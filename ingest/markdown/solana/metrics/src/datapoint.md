The `datapoint.rs` file in the Solana project provides a set of macros for reporting metrics with different log levels. These macros allow developers to easily log metrics with optional tags and fields, which can be used for querying and grouping the reported samples.

The main structure defined in this file is `DataPoint`, which represents a single metric data point. It contains a name, timestamp, tags, and fields. The `DataPoint` structure provides methods for adding tags and fields of different types (bool, i64, f64, and String).

The file also defines a set of macros for creating and logging `DataPoint` instances with different log levels: `datapoint_error!`, `datapoint_warn!`, `datapoint_trace!`, `datapoint_info!`, and `datapoint_debug!`. These macros make it easy to create and log metrics with the desired log level, name, tags, and fields.

Here's an example of how to use these macros:

```rust
datapoint_debug!(
    "name-of-the-metric",
    "tag" => "tag-value",
    "tag2" => "tag-value2",
    ("some-bool", false, bool),
    ("some-int", 100, i64),
    ("some-float", 1.05, f64),
    ("some-string", "field-value", String),
);
```

This code creates a `DataPoint` with the name "name-of-the-metric", two tags, and four fields of different types. The metric is logged with the `Debug` log level.

In the larger project, these macros can be used to log various metrics throughout the codebase, making it easier to monitor the performance and behavior of the system. The tags and fields attached to each metric can be used to filter and group the data when analyzing the logs.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DataPoint` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `DataPoint` struct represents a metric data point with a name, timestamp, tags, and fields. The associated methods are used to create a new `DataPoint`, add tags and fields to it, and implement the `Display` trait for formatting the output.

2. **Question**: How do the different macros (`datapoint_error!`, `datapoint_warn!`, `datapoint_trace!`, `datapoint_info!`, `datapoint_debug!`) differ from each other?
   **Answer**: Each macro corresponds to a different log level (Error, Warn, Trace, Info, Debug) and is used to report a metric with the specified log level. They all use the `datapoint!` macro internally with the appropriate log level as the first argument.

3. **Question**: How are tags and fields added to a `DataPoint` using the macros?
   **Answer**: Tags and fields are added to a `DataPoint` using the `create_datapoint!` macro. Tags are specified using the syntax `"tag-name" => "tag-value"` and fields are specified using the syntax `("field-name", "field-value", field-type)`. The macro processes the tags and fields and calls the appropriate methods on the `DataPoint` struct to add them.
