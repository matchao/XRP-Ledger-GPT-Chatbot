The `poh_timing_point.rs` file contains the implementation of a module that provides a way to track the timing of Proof of History (PoH) events in Solana. The module defines three types: `PohTimingPoint`, `SlotPohTimingInfo`, `PohTimingReceiver`, and `PohTimingSender`.

`PohTimingPoint` is an enumeration that represents the different types of PoH timing events that can occur. It has three variants: `PohSlotStart`, `PohSlotEnd`, and `FullSlotReceived`. Each variant is annotated with a timestamp in milliseconds.

`SlotPohTimingInfo` is a struct that contains information about a PoH timing event. It has three fields: `slot`, `root_slot`, and `timing_point`. `slot` is the current slot, `root_slot` is the root slot, and `timing_point` is a `PohTimingPoint` variant that represents the timing event.

`PohTimingReceiver` and `PohTimingSender` are type aliases for `Receiver<SlotPohTimingInfo>` and `Sender<SlotPohTimingInfo>`, respectively. They are used to send and receive `SlotPohTimingInfo` structs between threads.

The module also defines three methods on `SlotPohTimingInfo` that create new instances of the struct for each of the `PohTimingPoint` variants. These methods are `new_slot_start_poh_time_point`, `new_slot_end_poh_time_point`, and `new_slot_full_poh_time_point`.

Finally, the module defines a function `send_poh_timing_point` that sends a `SlotPohTimingInfo` struct to a `PohTimingSender`. This function is used to send PoH timing information to the `poh_timing_report` service.

Overall, this module provides a way to track the timing of PoH events in Solana and send that information to other parts of the system for analysis and reporting. For example, the `poh_timing_report` service could use this module to collect PoH timing information from multiple sources and generate reports on the performance of the PoH system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this module?
- This module defines a set of types and functions for tracking the timing of Proof of History (PoH) events in Solana.

2. What is the relationship between `PohTimingPoint` and `SlotPohTimingInfo`?
- `PohTimingPoint` is an enum that represents different types of PoH timing events, while `SlotPohTimingInfo` is a struct that contains information about a specific PoH timing event, including the current slot, root slot, and timing point.

3. What is the purpose of the `send_poh_timing_point` function?
- This function sends a `SlotPohTimingInfo` struct to a `PohTimingSender` channel, which can be received by a `poh_timing_report` service to track PoH timing information. If an error occurs while sending the struct, an error message is logged.
