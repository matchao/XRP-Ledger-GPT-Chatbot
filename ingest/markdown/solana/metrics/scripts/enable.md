The `enable.sh` script is used to enable metrics in the current shell for the Solana project. Metrics are used to collect and analyze data about the performance and behavior of the Solana network. This information can be used to identify and resolve issues, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about future development.

The script first defines a function called `echoSolanaMetricsConfig()`. This function sets the `metrics_config_sh` variable to the path of the `config.sh` file located in the `lib` directory relative to the current script. If the `config.sh` file does not exist, the function returns an error message and exits with a status of 1.

Next, the function sources the `config.sh` file and echoes a string containing the InfluxDB connection information. InfluxDB is a time-series database used to store and query metrics data. The connection information includes the hostname, port number, database name, and authentication credentials for the InfluxDB write user.

The `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` variable is then set to the output of the `echoSolanaMetricsConfig()` function, and exported so that it can be accessed by other scripts and processes in the current shell.

Finally, the `echoSolanaMetricsConfig()` function is unset to prevent it from being called again, and the `configure-metrics.sh` script is sourced if it exists. The `configure-metrics.sh` script is used to configure the Solana node to collect and send metrics data to InfluxDB.

Overall, the `enable.sh` script is a small but important piece of the Solana metrics system. By sourcing this script, developers and operators can enable metrics collection and analysis in their local environment, allowing them to monitor and optimize the performance of the Solana network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script enables metrics in the current shell.
2. What is the expected format of the `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` variable?
   - The `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` variable should be a string in the format `host=http://localhost:8086,db=testnet,u=$INFLUXDB_WRITE_USER,p=$INFLUXDB_WRITE_PASSWORD`.
3. What is the purpose of the `configure-metrics.sh` script and how is it used in this file?
   - The `configure-metrics.sh` script is used to configure metrics for Solana. In this file, the script is sourced if it exists in the expected location.
