The `adjust-dashboard-for-channel.py` script is used to adjust the Solana testnet monitor dashboard based on the specified release channel. The script takes two arguments: the path to the dashboard JSON file and the release channel. 

If the release channel is not one of `edge`, `beta`, `stable`, or `local`, the script will exit with an error. Otherwise, it will open the dashboard JSON file and modify it based on the release channel. 

If the release channel is `local`, the script will modify the dashboard to display information for a local cluster. It will change the title of the dashboard to "Local Cluster Monitor", set the unique identifier to "local", and remove all links. It will also modify the templating section to include a list of data sources, testnets, and host IDs. 

If the release channel is `stable`, the script will modify the dashboard to display information for the mainnet-beta, devnet, and tds testnets. It will change the title of the dashboard to "Cluster Telemetry", set the unique identifier to "monitor", and modify the templating section to include a list of data sources, testnets, and host IDs. 

If the release channel is anything other than `local` or `stable`, the script will modify the dashboard to display information for the specified release channel. It will change the title of the dashboard to "Cluster Telemetry (channel)", set the unique identifier to "monitor-channel", and modify the templating section to include a list of data sources, testnets, and host IDs. 

The modified dashboard JSON is then written back to the original file. 

This script is useful for quickly modifying the Solana testnet monitor dashboard based on the release channel being used. It allows users to easily switch between different testnets and view relevant information without having to manually modify the dashboard. 

Example usage: 

```
python3 adjust-dashboard-for-channel.py /path/to/dashboard.json beta
```
