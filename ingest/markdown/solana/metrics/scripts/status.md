The `status.sh` script is a Bash script that checks the status of local metrics for the Solana project. The purpose of this script is to ensure that the necessary services are running and to provide information on how to enable metric collection.

The script starts by setting the execution to stop if any command fails (`set -e`) and changing the current directory to the directory where the script is located (`cd "$(dirname "$0")"`).

Next, the script checks if the `lib/config.sh` file exists. If it doesn't exist, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1. This check ensures that the necessary configuration file is present before proceeding.

The script then sources the `lib/config.sh` file, which sets environment variables for the InfluxDB admin user, InfluxDB admin password, InfluxDB write user, and InfluxDB write password. These environment variables are used later in the script.

The script then runs a Docker command to list all running containers (`docker ps --no-trunc --size`). This command is executed in a subshell (`(` and `)`), and the `-x` option is used to print each command before it is executed. This command is used to provide information on the running containers.

The script then defines a function called `curl_head` that sends an HTTP HEAD request to a specified URL using the `curl` command. This function retries the request up to 5 times with a delay of 2 seconds between each retry if the connection is refused. This function is used to check if InfluxDB and Grafana are running.

The script then uses the `curl_head` function to check if InfluxDB is running by sending an HTTP HEAD request to `http://localhost:8086/ping`. If the request fails, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

The script then uses the `curl_head` function to check if Grafana is running by sending an HTTP HEAD request to `http://localhost:3000`. If the request fails, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

Finally, the script prints a message that provides information on how to access the Grafana dashboard and how to enable metric collection per shell.

Overall, this script is used to check the status of local metrics for the Solana project and to provide information on how to enable metric collection. It ensures that the necessary services are running and provides information on how to access the Grafana dashboard. This script is likely used as part of a larger system for monitoring and analyzing metrics for the Solana project.
