The `geyser_plugin_interface.rs` file defines the interface for Geyser plugins in the Solana project. Geyser plugins are used to stream data from the runtime, and they must implement the `GeyserPlugin` trait to work with the system. The file provides several structures and enums to represent different versions of account and transaction information, as well as slot status and block information.

The `ReplicaAccountInfo`, `ReplicaAccountInfoV2`, and `ReplicaAccountInfoV3` structures represent different versions of account information, with each version extending the previous one with additional fields. The `ReplicaAccountInfoVersions` enum is a wrapper to future-proof handling of these structures.

Similarly, the `ReplicaTransactionInfo` and `ReplicaTransactionInfoV2` structures represent different versions of transaction information, and the `ReplicaTransactionInfoVersions` enum is a wrapper for these structures.

The `ReplicaBlockInfo` and `ReplicaBlockInfoV2` structures represent different versions of block information, and the `ReplicaBlockInfoVersions` enum is a wrapper for these structures.

The `GeyserPlugin` trait defines the required methods for a Geyser plugin, such as `on_load`, `on_unload`, `update_account`, `notify_end_of_startup`, `update_slot_status`, `notify_transaction`, `notify_block_metadata`, `account_data_notifications_enabled`, and `transaction_notifications_enabled`. These methods allow the plugin to handle va
