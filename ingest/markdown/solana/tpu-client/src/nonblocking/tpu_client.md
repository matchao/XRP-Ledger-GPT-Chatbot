The `tpu_client.rs` file in the `solana/tpu-client/src/nonblocking` directory provides a non-blocking client for sending transactions directly to the current leader's TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) port over UDP. The client uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to determine the current leader and fetch node contact information.

The `TpuClient` struct is the main component of this module, and it provides methods for sending transactions and wire transactions to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size. The fanout size determines how many upcoming leader TPUs the client should send transactions to. The `TpuClient` struct also contains a `LeaderTpuService` that tracks upcoming leaders and maintains an up-to-date mapping of leader ID to TPU socket address.

The `LeaderTpuService` struct is responsible for updating the leader TPU cache with new information about the current leader, upcoming leaders, and their TPU socket addresses. It does this by periodically fetching the latest leader schedule, cluster nodes, and epoch information from the RPC client and updating the `LeaderTpuCache` accordingly.

Here's an example of how to create a new `TpuClient`:

```rust
let rpc_client = Arc::new(RpcClient::new("http://localhost:8899".to_string()));
let websocket_url = "ws://localhost:8900";
let config = TpuClientConfig { fanout_slots: 2 };
let connection_manager = ConnectionManager::new();
let tpu_client = TpuClient::new(rpc_client, websocket_url, config, connection_manager).await?;
```

And here's an example of how to send a transaction using the `TpuClient`:

```rust
let transaction = Transaction::new_unsigned(message);
tpu_client.send_transaction(&transaction).await;
```

The `TpuClient` also provides a `send_and_confirm_messages_with_spinner` method (when the "spinner" feature is enabled) that sends and confirms a batch of messages with a progress bar.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TpuClient` struct and how does it interact with the `LeaderTpuService`?
   **Answer**: The `TpuClient` struct is a client that sends transactions directly to the current leader's TPU port over UDP. It uses RPC to determine the current leader and fetch node contact info. The `LeaderTpuService` is a service that tracks upcoming leaders and maintains an up-to-date mapping of leader id to TPU socket address. The `TpuClient` interacts with the `LeaderTpuService` to get the leader TPU sockets and send transactions to the appropriate leader TPU.

2. **Question**: How does the `send_and_confirm_messages_with_spinner` function work and when should it be used?
   **Answer**: The `send_and_confirm_messages_with_spinner` function is used to send and confirm a batch of messages with a progress spinner. It serializes and sends the messages, periodically re-sends pending transactions, and checks for transaction statuses. This function should be used when sending multiple transactions and wanting to display a progress spinner to indicate the progress of sending and confirming the transactions.

3. **Question**: How does the `LeaderTpuCache` struct manage the leader TPU sockets and what is the purpose of the `update_all` function?
   **Answer**: The `LeaderTpuCache` struct maintains a cache of leader TPU sockets, leader pubkeys, and other related information. The `update_all` function is used to update the cache with new information fetched from the RPC client, such as cluster nodes, epoch info, and slot leaders. This helps keep the cache up-to-date and ensures that the TPU client sends transactions to the correct leader TPU sockets.
