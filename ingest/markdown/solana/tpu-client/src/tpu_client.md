The `tpu_client.rs` file defines the `TpuClient` struct, which is responsible for sending transactions directly to the current leader's TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) port over UDP. The client uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to determine the current leader and fetch node contact information. The `TpuClient` struct is generic over three types: `P`, `M`, and `C`, which represent the connection pool, connection manager, and new connection configuration, respectively.

The `TpuClient` struct provides several methods for sending transactions:

- `send_transaction`: Serialize and send a transaction to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size.
- `send_wire_transaction`: Send a wire transaction to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size.
- `try_send_transaction`: Serialize and send a transaction to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size, returning the last error if all sends fail.
- `try_send_transaction_batch`: Serialize and send a batch of transactions to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size, returning the last error if all sends fail.
- `try_send_wire_transaction`: Send a wire transaction to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size, returning the last error if all sends fail.

The `TpuClient` can be created using the `new` or `new_with_connection_cache` methods, which take an `RpcClient`, a WebSocket URL, a `TpuClientConfig`, and either a connection manager or a connection cache.

The `TpuClientConfig` struct contains a single field, `fanout_slots`, which determines the range of upcoming slots to include when determining which leaders to send transactions to.

The `RecentLeaderSlots` struct is used to estimate the current slot from recent slot notifications. It maintains a list of recent slots and provides methods to record a new slot and estimate the current slot based on the recent slots.

In summary, the `tpu_client.rs` file defines a client for sending transactions directly to the leader's TPU port over UDP, using RPC to determine the current leader and fetch node contact information. The client provides methods for sending individual transactions, wire transactions, and batches of transactions, and can be configured with a custom fanout size.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TpuClient` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `TpuClient` struct is a client that sends transactions directly to the current leader's TPU port over UDP. It uses RPC to determine the current leader and fetch node contact info. The associated methods provide functionality for sending transactions, wire transactions, and batches of transactions to the current and upcoming leader TPUs according to the fanout size.

2. **Question**: What is the role of the `RecentLeaderSlots` struct and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `RecentLeaderSlots` struct is used to store and manage recent leader slots. It provides methods to record a new slot, estimate the current slot from recent slot notifications, and ensure that the current slot is in line with the recent progression. This helps in maintaining a record of recent leader slots and estimating the current slot based on the recent history.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TpuClientConfig` struct and its default implementation?
   **Answer**: The `TpuClientConfig` struct is used to store configuration parameters for the `TpuClient`. It contains a field `fanout_slots`, which represents the range of upcoming slots to include when determining which leaders to send transactions to. The default implementation sets the `fanout_slots` to the value of `DEFAULT_FANOUT_SLOTS`, which is 12.
