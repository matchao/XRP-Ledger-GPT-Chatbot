The `config.rs` file contains the implementation of the Solana CLI configuration. It defines a `Config` struct that holds various configuration options for the CLI. The `Config` struct has several fields, including `json_rpc_url`, `websocket_url`, `keypair_path`, `address_labels`, and `commitment`. These fields represent the RPC address of a Solana validator node, the address to connect to for receiving event notifications, the default signing source, a mapping from Solana addresses to human-readable names, and the default commitment level, respectively.

The `Config` struct also implements several methods, including `load`, `save`, `compute_websocket_url`, `import_address_labels`, and `export_address_labels`. These methods allow users to load and save configurations from and to files, compute the websocket URL from the RPC URL, import and export address labels, and more.

The `CONFIG_FILE` constant is a `lazy_static` that represents the default path to the CLI configuration file. It is a `Option<String>` that is set to `~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml` by default. The `load_config_file` and `save_config_file` functions are used to load and save configurations from and to files, respectively.

The `test` module contains a single test function that tests the `compute_websocket_url` method. This method takes a JSON RPC URL and computes the corresponding websocket URL. It adds 1 to the port number and uses the "wss" scheme if the RPC URL has an "https" scheme, or the "ws" scheme if the RPC URL has an "http" scheme.

Overall, the `config.rs` file provides a way for users to configure the Solana CLI and customize its behavior. It allows users to set various options, load and save configurations from and to files, and more.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CONFIG_FILE` lazy static variable?
- `CONFIG_FILE` is a lazy static variable that holds the default path to the CLI configuration file. It is a `Option<String>` type that is `None` if it is unable to identify the user's home directory, which should not happen under typical OS environments.

2. What is the purpose of the `Config` struct?
- The `Config` struct represents the Solana CLI configuration and contains fields for the RPC address of a Solana validator node, the address to connect to for receiving event notifications, the default signing source, a mapping from Solana addresses to human-readable names, and the default commitment level.

3. What is the purpose of the `compute_websocket_url` function?
- The `compute_websocket_url` function computes the websocket URL from the RPC URL by adding 1 to the port number and using the "wss" scheme if the RPC URL has an "https" scheme, or the "ws" scheme if the RPC URL has an "http" scheme. If `json_rpc_url` cannot be parsed as a URL then this function returns the empty string.
