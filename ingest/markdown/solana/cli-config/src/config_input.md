The `config_input.rs` file contains a Rust module that defines a `ConfigInput` struct and several associated functions. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to compute various configuration settings for the Solana command-line interface (CLI) based on a combination of explicit user input, configuration file settings, and system defaults.

The `ConfigInput` struct contains four fields: `json_rpc_url`, `websocket_url`, `keypair_path`, and `commitment`. These fields correspond to various configuration settings that can be used to interact with the Solana network. The associated functions defined in the module are used to compute the values of these fields based on user input and other factors.

The `default_keypair_path()`, `default_json_rpc_url()`, and `default_websocket_url()` functions are used to compute the default values for the corresponding fields. These functions simply return the default values defined in the `Config` struct.

The `first_nonempty_setting()` function is used to find the first non-empty setting in a vector of `(SettingType, String)` tuples. This function is used by the `compute_websocket_url_setting()`, `compute_json_rpc_url_setting()`, and `compute_keypair_path_setting()` functions to determine the appropriate value for the corresponding configuration setting.

The `first_setting_is_some()` function is used to find the first setting in a vector of `(SettingType, Option<T>)` tuples where the `Option` value is `Some`. This function is used by the `compute_commitment_config()` function to determine the appropriate value for the `commitment` field.

The `compute_websocket_url_setting()`, `compute_json_rpc_url_setting()`, `compute_keypair_path_setting()`, and `compute_commitment_config()` functions are used to compute the values of the corresponding configuration settings based on user input and other factors. These functions take various input parameters and return a tuple containing the `SettingType` (which indicates whether the value was explicitly set, computed, or a system default) and the computed value.

Overall, this module provides a flexible way to compute various configuration settings for the Solana CLI based on a combination of user input and other factors. This allows users to easily customize their Solana CLI experience while still providing sensible defaults for those who don't want to spend time configuring every setting. Here is an example of how this module might be used:

```
use solana_cli_config::config_input::ConfigInput;

let (setting_type, websocket_url) = ConfigInput::compute_websocket_url_setting(
    "wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/1234",
    "",
    "",
    "",
);

println!("Websocket URL: {} ({:?})", websocket_url, setting_type);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConfigInput` struct and its associated functions?
- The `ConfigInput` struct represents input configuration options for a Solana client, and its associated functions provide default values and compute settings based on command line arguments and configuration files.
2. What is the purpose of the `SettingType` enum?
- The `SettingType` enum represents the source of a configuration setting, whether it was explicitly set by the user, computed based on other settings, or is a system default.
3. What is the purpose of the `normalize_to_url_if_moniker` function?
- The `normalize_to_url_if_moniker` function is an input validator that converts a string to a URL if it matches a known network moniker, such as "devnet" or "testnet".
