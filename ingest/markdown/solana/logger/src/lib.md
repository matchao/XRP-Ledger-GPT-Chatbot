The `logger` module in the Solana project configures the Rust logging framework `env_logger`. The module provides functions to set up logging with different filters and to log to a file. 

The module uses the `lazy_static` crate to create a global `LOGGER` instance that is an `Arc` (atomic reference count) wrapped in an `RwLock` (read-write lock). The `LOGGER` instance is initialized with the default logger from the `env_logger` crate. 

The `LoggerShim` struct is an implementation of the `log::Log` trait that delegates logging calls to the `LOGGER` instance. The `replace_logger` function replaces the global `LOGGER` instance with a new logger and sets the maximum log level based on the new logger's filter. It also sets a new `LoggerShim` instance as the boxed logger for the `log` crate. 

The `setup_with` function configures logging with a specific filter, overriding the `RUST_LOG` environment variable if it is set. The `setup_with_default` function configures logging with a default filter if `RUST_LOG` is not set. The `setup` function configures logging with the default filter "error" if `RUST_LOG` is not set. The `setup_file_with_default` function configures file logging with a default filter if `RUST_LOG` is not set. 

Here is an example of how to use the `logger` module to set up logging with a filter of "info" and log to a file named "mylog.log":

```rust
use solana_logger::setup_file_with_default;

fn main() {
    setup_file_with_default("mylog.log", "info");
    log::info!("Logging initialized");
}
``` 

This will create a new file "mylog.log" in the current directory and log messages with a level of "info" or higher to the file. The `log::info!` macro can be used to log messages at the "info" level.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `lazy_static` crate in this code?
   - The `lazy_static` crate is used to create a global static variable `LOGGER` that is initialized lazily and can be accessed from multiple threads.
2. What is the role of the `LoggerShim` struct in this code?
   - The `LoggerShim` struct implements the `log::Log` trait and is used to forward log messages to the global `LOGGER` variable.
3. What is the difference between the `setup_with_default` and `setup_file_with_default` functions?
   - The `setup_with_default` function configures logging to the console with a default filter, while the `setup_file_with_default` function configures logging to a file with a default filter.
