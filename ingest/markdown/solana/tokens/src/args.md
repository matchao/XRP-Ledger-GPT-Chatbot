The `args.rs` file in the `solana/tokens/src` directory contains several structs and enums that define the arguments used in various commands related to token distribution and management. These arguments are used in the larger Solana project to facilitate the creation, distribution, and management of tokens on the Solana blockchain.

The `SenderStakeArgs` struct defines the arguments required to stake tokens on behalf of a sender. It includes the address of the stake account, the authority to stake the tokens, the authority to withdraw the tokens, and an optional lockup authority. This struct is used in the `StakeArgs` struct, which defines the arguments required to stake tokens. It includes the amount of unlocked SOL, an optional lockup authority, and an optional `SenderStakeArgs` struct.

The `DistributeTokensArgs` struct defines the arguments required to distribute tokens to a list of recipients. It includes the input CSV file containing the list of recipients and their token amounts, the transaction database file, an optional output path, a flag indicating whether to perform a dry run, the keypair of the sender, the fee payer, an optional `StakeArgs` struct, an optional `SplTokenArgs` struct, and an optional transfer amount.

The `SplTokenArgs` struct defines the arguments required to manage a token account. It includes the address of the token account, the mint address, and the number of decimals.

The `BalancesArgs` struct defines the arguments required to retrieve the balances of a list of token accounts. It includes the input CSV file containing the list of token accounts and an optional `SplTokenArgs` struct.

The `TransactionLogArgs` struct defines the arguments required to generate a log of token transactions. It includes the transaction database file and the output path.

Finally, the `Command` enum defines the available commands that can be executed using these arguments. These commands include distributing tokens, retrieving balances, and generating transaction logs.

Overall, the `args.rs` file provides a set of standardized arguments that can be used across various token-related commands in the Solana project. By defining these arguments in a structured way, the code is more modular and easier to maintain. Here is an example of how the `DistributeTokensArgs` struct might be used in a command:

```
let args = DistributeTokensArgs {
    input_csv: "recipients.csv".to_string(),
    transaction_db: "transactions.db".to_string(),
    output_path: Some("log.txt".to_string()),
    dry_run: false,
    sender_keypair: Box::new(sender_keypair),
    fee_payer: Box::new(fee_payer),
    stake_args: Some(stake_args),
    spl_token_args: Some(spl_token_args),
    transfer_amount: Some(100),
};

let result = distribute_tokens(args);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SenderStakeArgs` struct?
- The `SenderStakeArgs` struct contains information about a stake account's address, stake authority, withdraw authority, and lockup authority (if any) for a specific sender.

2. What is the `SplTokenArgs` struct used for?
- The `SplTokenArgs` struct contains information about a token account's address, mint, and decimals for a specific SPL token.

3. What is the purpose of the `Command` enum?
- The `Command` enum defines the different types of commands that can be executed by the program, including distributing tokens, checking balances, and logging transactions.
