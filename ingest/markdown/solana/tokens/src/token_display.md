The `token_display.rs` file in the Solana project defines a `Token` struct and related functionality for displaying and formatting token amounts. The `Token` struct contains an `amount` field of type `u64`, a `decimals` field of type `u8`, and a `token_type` field of type `TokenType`. The `TokenType` enum defines two possible values: `Sol` and `SplToken`. 

The `Token` struct has two associated functions: `sol` and `spl_token`. These functions create a new `Token` instance with the specified `amount`, `decimals`, and `token_type`. The `sol` function sets the `token_type` to `Sol` and the `decimals` to 9, while the `spl_token` function allows the caller to specify the `decimals` value.

The `Token` struct also implements the `Display` and `Debug` traits, which allow instances of the struct to be printed to the console or formatted as strings. The `write_with_symbol` function is used to format the `Token` instance with the appropriate symbol based on its `token_type`. If the `token_type` is `Sol`, the `lamports_to_sol` function is used to convert the `amount` to SOL and the `SOL_SYMBOL` constant is prepended to the formatted string. If the `token_type` is `SplToken`, the `real_number_string_trimmed` function is used to format the `amount` with the specified number of `decimals` and the string "tokens" is appended to the formatted string.

Finally, the `Token` struct implements the `Add` trait, which allows instances of the struct to be added together. The `add` function checks that the two `Token` instances being added have the same `token_type`. If they do, a new `Token` instance is created with the sum of the `amount` fields and the same `token_type` and `decimals` values as the original instances. If the `token_type` values are different, the function returns the first `Token` instance unchanged.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to work with token amounts in the Solana project. The `Token` struct and associated functions allow developers to easily create and manipulate token amounts, while the `Display` and `Debug` traits provide a consistent way to format and display these amounts. The `Add` trait implementation also allows for easy addition of token amounts, as long as they have the same `token_type`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Token` struct and its associated methods?
- The `Token` struct represents a token with an amount, number of decimals, and type (either SOL or SPL). Its methods allow for formatting and displaying the token amount with the appropriate symbol.

2. What is the significance of the `Add` trait implementation for the `Token` struct?
- The `Add` trait allows for adding two `Token` instances together, as long as they have the same token type. The resulting `Token` will have the sum of the amounts of the two original tokens.

3. What is the purpose of the `real_number_string_trimmed` function from the `solana_account_decoder` crate?
- The `real_number_string_trimmed` function formats a given number with a specified number of decimal places, removing any trailing zeros and decimal point if unnecessary. It is used to format the amount of SPL tokens in the `Token` struct's `write_with_symbol` method.
