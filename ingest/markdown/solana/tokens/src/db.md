The `db.rs` file in the Solana tokens project is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of transaction information using a PickleDB database. It defines a `TransactionInfo` struct that holds information about a transaction, such as the recipient, amount, new stake account address, finalized date, transaction object, last valid block height, and lockup date.

The `open_db` function is used to open or create a PickleDB database with the specified path and dump policy. The dump policy determines whether the database should be saved to disk or not, depending on the `dry_run` flag.

The `compare_transaction_infos` function is used to compare two `TransactionInfo` objects based on their finalized date and recipient. This is useful for sorting a list of transactions.

The `write_transaction_log` function writes a CSV file containing transaction information from the PickleDB database. It first reads the transaction information from the database, sorts it using `compare_transaction_infos`, and then writes it to the CSV file.

The `read_transaction_infos` function reads all transaction information from the PickleDB database and returns a vector of `TransactionInfo` objects.

The `set_transaction_info` function is used to store a new transaction in the PickleDB database. It takes the transaction details as input, creates a `TransactionInfo` object, and stores it in the database using the transaction signature as the key.

The `update_finalized_transaction` function updates the finalized status of a transaction in the PickleDB database. It checks if the transaction is rooted, failed, or still being confirmed, and updates the database accordingly.

The `check_output_file` function is used to verify that the output CSV file matches the transaction information stored in the PickleDB database. It reads the CSV file and compares it with the transaction information from the database.

The `tests` module contains unit tests for the functions defined in this file, ensuring their correct behavior.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TransactionInfo` struct and its fields?
   **Answer**: The `TransactionInfo` struct is used to store information about a transaction, including the recipient's public key, the amount being transferred, an optional new stake account address, an optional finalized date, the transaction itself, the last valid block height, and an optional lockup date.

2. **Question**: How does the `open_db` function handle the case when the database file does not exist?
   **Answer**: If the database file does not exist, the `open_db` function creates the parent directory if it does not exist, and then initializes a new PickleDb instance with the given path and dump policy.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `update_finalized_transaction` function and how does it handle different transaction statuses?
   **Answer**: The `update_finalized_transaction` function is used to update the finalized status of a transaction in the database. It handles different transaction statuses by checking if the transaction is still in flight, has been finalized, or has failed. Depending on the status, it either updates the finalized date, removes the transaction from the database, or returns the number of confirmations.
