The `parse_account_data` function in `parse_account_data.rs` is responsible for parsing account data for various programs in the Solana blockchain. The function takes in four arguments: `pubkey`, `program_id`, `data`, and `additional_data`. The `pubkey` argument is the public key of the account being parsed, `program_id` is the program ID of the account being parsed, `data` is the account data to be parsed, and `additional_data` is an optional argument that provides additional data required to parse certain types of accounts.

The function first checks if the `program_id` is one of the supported programs by checking if it exists in the `PARSABLE_PROGRAM_IDS` hashmap. If the program is not supported, the function returns an error. If the program is supported, the function uses a match statement to determine which parsing function to call based on the program ID. The parsing functions are located in other files in the `account-decoder` module.

Once the parsing function is called, the account data is parsed and converted to a JSON object using the `serde_json::to_value` function. The parsed JSON object is then returned as a `ParsedAccount` struct, which contains the program name, the parsed JSON object, and the size of the account data.

The `PARSABLE_PROGRAM_IDS` hashmap contains the supported program IDs and their corresponding `ParsableAccount` enum values. The `ParsableAccount` enum is used to determine which parsing function to call based on the program ID.

The `AccountAdditionalData` struct is used to provide additional data required to parse certain types of accounts. Currently, the only additional data supported is the number of decimals for SPL tokens.

The `test` module contains unit tests for the `parse_account_data` function. The tests ensure that the function returns the correct `ParsedAccount` struct for different types of accounts.

Overall, the `parse_account_data` function is an important part of the Solana blockchain as it allows developers to easily parse account data for various programs. This function is used in other parts of the Solana codebase to provide information about accounts to users and developers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `parse_account_data` function?
- The `parse_account_data` function takes in account data, program ID, and additional data (optional) and returns a parsed account object with program name, parsed data, and space.

2. What is the purpose of the `ParsableAccount` enum?
- The `ParsableAccount` enum lists the different types of accounts that can be parsed by the `parse_account_data` function.

3. What is the purpose of the `PARSABLE_PROGRAM_IDS` hashmap?
- The `PARSABLE_PROGRAM_IDS` hashmap maps program IDs to their corresponding `ParsableAccount` enum values, allowing the `parse_account_data` function to determine which parsing function to use based on the program ID.
