The `TransactionExecutor` struct in `transaction_executor.rs` is responsible for executing transactions on the Solana blockchain. It maintains a queue of pending transactions and periodically checks their status to remove any that have been confirmed or have timed out. 

The `TransactionExecutor` struct has several fields, including a `sigs` field that is an `Arc<RwLock<PendingQueue>>`, which is a vector of tuples containing the signature, timestamp, and ID of each pending transaction. The `cleared` field is an `Arc<RwLock<Vec<u64>>>` that stores the IDs of transactions that have been confirmed or timed out. The `exit` field is an `Arc<AtomicBool>` that is used to signal the background thread to exit. The `counter` field is an `AtomicU64` that is used to assign unique IDs to each transaction. Finally, the `client` field is an instance of `RpcClient` that is used to send transactions to the Solana network.

The `TransactionExecutor` struct has several methods. The `new` method creates a new instance of `TransactionExecutor` and starts a background thread to periodically check the status of pending transactions. The `num_outstanding` method returns the number of pending transactions. The `push_transactions` method takes a vector of transactions, sends them to the Solana network, and adds them to the pending queue. It returns a vector of IDs that can be used to track the status of each transaction. The `drain_cleared` method removes and returns the IDs of transactions that have been confirmed or timed out. Finally, the `close` method signals the background thread to exit and waits for it to finish.

The background thread is started by the `start_sig_clear_thread` method. This method takes the `exit`, `sigs`, and `cleared` fields as arguments, along with the address of a Solana node. It creates a new `RpcClient` instance and enters a loop that periodically checks the status of pending transactions. It groups the pending transactions into chunks of 200 and uses the `get_signature_statuses` method of `RpcClient` to check their status. It then removes any transactions that have been confirmed or timed out from the pending queue and adds their IDs to the `cleared` field. The loop sleeps for 200 milliseconds between iterations.

Overall, the `TransactionExecutor` struct provides a convenient way to send and track transactions on the Solana blockchain. It abstracts away the details of sending transactions and checking their status, allowing developers to focus on building their applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionExecutor` struct?
- The `TransactionExecutor` struct is responsible for sending transactions to the Solana network and keeping track of their status.

2. What is the significance of the `sigs` and `cleared` fields in the `TransactionExecutor` struct?
- The `sigs` field is an `Arc<RwLock<PendingQueue>>` that holds a list of pending transactions waiting to be cleared. The `cleared` field is an `Arc<RwLock<Vec<u64>>>` that holds a list of transaction IDs that have been cleared.

3. What is the purpose of the `start_sig_clear_thread` function?
- The `start_sig_clear_thread` function is responsible for periodically checking the status of pending transactions and moving cleared transactions from the `sigs` field to the `cleared` field. It runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main thread.
