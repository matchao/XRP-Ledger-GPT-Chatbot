The `connection_cache.rs` file provides a thin wrapper over the `connection-cache/ConnectionCache` to ease the construction of the ConnectionCache for code dealing with both UDP and QUIC protocols. It is designed to be used in scenarios where both UDP and QUIC are used. For scenarios using only one of the protocols, it is recommended to use `connection-cache/ConnectionCache` directly.

The `ConnectionCache` enum has two variants, `Quic` and `Udp`, each containing an `Arc` reference to a `BackendConnectionCache` with the respective protocol's configuration. The `BlockingClientConnection` and `NonblockingClientConnection` enums also have `Quic` and `Udp` variants, each containing an `Arc` reference to the respective protocol's `BaseClientConnection`.

The `ConnectionCache` provides methods to create a new instance with QUIC or UDP configurations, such as `new`, `new_with_client_options`, and `with_udp`. It also provides methods to get a blocking or non-blocking connection to a specified address, such as `get_connection` and `get_nonblocking_connection`.

The `impl Default for ConnectionCache` block provides a default implementation for creating a new `ConnectionCache` instance. By default, it uses QUIC with a default connection pool size and client certificate.

The `dispatch!` macro is used to define methods for the `ClientConnection` trait implementation for `BlockingClientConnection` and the `solana_connection_cache::nonblocking::client_connection::ClientConnection` trait implementation for `NonblockingClientConnection`. These methods include `server_addr`, `send_data`, `send_data_async`, `send_data_batch`, and `send_data_batch_async`.

The `#[cfg(test)]` block contains tests for the `ConnectionCache`, such as `test_connection_with_specified_client_endpoint`, which tests the creation of a `ConnectionCache` with a specified client endpoint and checks if the server addresses are correct.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ConnectionCache` enum and its variants?
   **Answer**: The `ConnectionCache` enum is a thin wrapper over the `connection-cache/ConnectionCache` to ease the construction of the ConnectionCache for code dealing with both UDP and QUIC. It has two variants, `Quic` and `Udp`, representing the QUIC and UDP connection caches, respectively.

2. **Question**: How does the `new_with_client_options` function work, and what are the different client options that can be provided?
   **Answer**: The `new_with_client_options` function creates a QUIC connection cache with more client options. The client options that can be provided are `connection_pool_size`, `client_endpoint`, `cert_info`, and `stake_info`. These options allow for more customization when creating the connection cache.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `dispatch!` macro in the code?
   **Answer**: The `dispatch!` macro is used to define methods for the `BlockingClientConnection` and `NonblockingClientConnection` enums that delegate the method calls to their respective variants (Quic or Udp). This makes it easier to implement the `ClientConnection` trait for both enums without duplicating code.
