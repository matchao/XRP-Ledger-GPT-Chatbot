The code in this file provides modules for non-blocking communication with a Solana node over various protocols. It includes modules for QUIC, TPU, UDP, and RPC clients, as well as modules for blockhash queries and durable transaction nonce helpers.

The `quic_client`, `tpu_client`, `tpu_connection`, and `udp_client` modules provide implementations for non-blocking communication with a Solana node over the respective protocols. These modules can be used to query the state of the Solana blockchain or submit transactions without blocking the calling thread.

The `blockhash_query` module provides a convenient way to use the `blockhash_query` module from the `solana_rpc_client_nonce_utils` crate in a non-blocking context. This module can be used to retrieve the current blockhash from a Solana node.

The `nonce_utils` module provides durable transaction nonce helpers for non-blocking communication. This module can be used to generate and retrieve durable nonces for transactions, which are used to prevent replay attacks.

The `pubsub_client` module provides a non-blocking implementation of a Solana pubsub client. This module can be used to subscribe to updates from a Solana node, such as new blocks or transactions.

The `rpc_client` module provides non-blocking communication with a Solana node over JSON-RPC. This module can be used to query the state of the Solana blockchain or submit transactions using the `RpcClient` type.

Overall, this file provides a set of modules for non-blocking communication with a Solana node over various protocols and for performing common tasks such as retrieving the current blockhash or generating durable nonces for transactions. These modules can be used by software that interacts with the Solana blockchain to perform tasks asynchronously without blocking the calling thread.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `quic_client`, `tpu_client`, `tpu_connection`, and `udp_client` modules?
   - These modules likely contain code for different types of clients that can communicate with a Solana node using different protocols.
2. What is the `blockhash_query` module and what does it contain?
   - The `blockhash_query` module appears to be a re-export of the `blockhash_query` module from `solana_rpc_client_nonce_utils`, which likely contains utilities for querying block hashes.
3. What is the `rpc_client` module and what does it contain?
   - The `rpc_client` module contains code for communicating with a Solana node over JSON-RPC using the `RpcClient` type. It likely provides functionality for querying the state of the blockchain and submitting transactions.
