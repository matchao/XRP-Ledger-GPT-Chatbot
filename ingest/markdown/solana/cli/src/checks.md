The `checks.rs` file in the Solana CLI project provides utility functions to check account balances and fees for transactions. These functions are used to ensure that an account has sufficient funds to cover transaction fees and spending requirements before executing a transaction.

The main functions provided in this file are:

1. `check_account_for_fee`: Checks if an account has enough balance to cover the fee for a single message.
2. `check_account_for_fee_with_commitment`: Similar to `check_account_for_fee`, but allows specifying a commitment level for the balance check.
3. `check_account_for_multiple_fees`: Checks if an account has enough balance to cover the fees for multiple messages.
4. `check_account_for_multiple_fees_with_commitment`: Similar to `check_account_for_multiple_fees`, but allows specifying a commitment level for the balance check.
5. `check_account_for_spend_multiple_fees_with_commitment`: Checks if an account has enough balance to cover both spending and fees for multiple messages with a specified commitment level.
6. `check_account_for_spend_and_fee_with_commitment`: Checks if an account has enough balance to cover both spending and fees for a single message with a specified commitment level.
7. `get_fee_for_messages`: Calculates the total fee for a list of messages.
8. `check_account_for_balance`: Checks if an account has a specified balance.
9. `check_account_for_balance_with_commitment`: Similar to `check_account_for_balance`, but allows specifying a commitment level for the balance check.
10. `check_unique_pubkeys`: Checks if two public keys are unique.

These functions are used in the larger project to ensure that transactions are only executed if the account has sufficient funds to cover the required fees and spending. For example, when sending a transaction, the CLI can use `check_account_for_fee` to ensure that the sender's account has enough balance to cover the transaction fee before proceeding.

Here's an example of how `check_account_for_fee` can be used:

```rust
let rpc_client = RpcClient::new("http://localhost:8899");
let account_pubkey = Pubkey::from_str("BPF64dVqvp3zEJYPmdWPEv5XW5yKx8j9oZruzT8x7mY9").unwrap();
let message = Message::new(&[instruction], Some(&account_pubkey));

check_account_for_fee(&rpc_client, &account_pubkey, &message)?;
```

This code snippet checks if the account with the specified public key has enough balance to cover the fee for the given message. If the account has insufficient funds, an error will be returned.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `check_account_for_fee` and `check_account_for_fee_with_commitment` functions, and how do they differ?
   **Answer**: The `check_account_for_fee` function checks if an account has enough balance to cover the fee for a given message, while `check_account_for_fee_with_commitment` does the same but allows specifying a custom commitment level for the RPC request. The latter provides more control over the confirmation level of the transaction.

2. **Question**: How does the `get_fee_for_messages` function calculate the total fee for a set of messages?
   **Answer**: The `get_fee_for_messages` function iterates through the given messages, calls the `rpc_client.get_fee_for_message()` method for each message, and then sums up the fees returned for all messages.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `check_unique_pubkeys` function, and when would it be used?
   **Answer**: The `check_unique_pubkeys` function checks if two given public keys are unique (not equal) and returns an error if they are identical. This function can be used to ensure that two public keys used in a transaction or operation are distinct, preventing potential issues caused by using the same key for different purposes.
