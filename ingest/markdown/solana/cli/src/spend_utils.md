The `spend_utils.rs` file contains functions and structures related to spending funds from a Solana account. The main purpose of this code is to resolve a spend transaction and check the account balance before sending the transaction to the Solana network.

The `SpendAmount` enum represents the amount of funds to be spent and has three variants: `All`, `Some`, and `RentExempt`. The `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balance` and `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balances` functions take in a `SpendAmount` parameter and use it to determine the amount of funds to be spent. The `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balance` function is a wrapper around `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balances` and sets the `fee_pubkey` parameter to be the same as the `from_pubkey` parameter.

The `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balances` function takes in several parameters, including the `rpc_client`, `sign_only`, `amount`, `blockhash`, `from_pubkey`, `fee_pubkey`, `build_message`, and `commitment`. It first checks if the `sign_only` parameter is set to true, in which case it resolves the spend message and returns it along with the spend amount. Otherwise, it checks the balance of the `from_pubkey` account and calculates the minimum rent-exempt balance if the `amount` parameter is set to `RentExempt`. It then resolves the spend message and checks if the `from_pubkey` account has sufficient funds to cover the spend and fee. If the `fee_pubkey` parameter is different from the `from_pubkey` parameter, it also checks if the `fee_pubkey` account has sufficient funds to cover the fee.

The `resolve_spend_message` function takes in several parameters, including the `rpc_client`, `amount`, `blockhash`, `from_balance`, `from_pubkey`, `fee_pubkey`, `from_rent_exempt_minimum`, and `build_message`. It first calculates the fee for the spend message based on the `blockhash` parameter and the `rpc_client`. It then determines the amount of funds to be spent based on the `amount` parameter and the balance of the `from_pubkey` account. If the `amount` parameter is set to `All` or `RentExempt`, it subtracts the fee from the spend amount if the `fee_pubkey` parameter is the same as the `from_pubkey` parameter. Finally, it returns the spend message along with the spend and fee amounts.

Overall, this code provides a way to resolve a spend transaction and check the account balance before sending the transaction to the Solana network. It can be used in the larger project to facilitate spending funds from Solana accounts in a safe and efficient manner. Here is an example usage of the `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balance` function:

```
let rpc_client = RpcClient::new("https://api.solana.com".to_string());
let sign_only = false;
let amount = SpendAmount::Some(1000000);
let blockhash = Hash::default();
let from_pubkey = Pubkey::new_unique();
let build_message = |lamports| Message::new(&[], None, vec![], Some(from_pubkey));
let commitment = CommitmentConfig::confirmed();
let result = resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balance(
    &rpc_client,
    sign_only,
    amount,
    &blockhash,
    &from_pubkey,
    build_message,
    commitment,
);
match result {
    Ok((message, spend)) => {
        // Send the spend transaction to the Solana network
    },
    Err(error) => {
        // Handle the error
    },
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SpendAmount` enum and how is it used in the code?
- The `SpendAmount` enum represents the different ways in which a user can specify the amount to spend, and it is used to create a spend transaction and check the account balance. It has methods to create a new instance from user input and to set a default value.
2. What is the role of the `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balances` function and what parameters does it take?
- The `resolve_spend_tx_and_check_account_balances` function resolves a spend transaction and checks the account balances to ensure that the sender has sufficient funds to cover the spend and fee. It takes several parameters including the RPC client, the spend amount, the blockhash, the sender's public key, the fee payer's public key, and a closure to build the spend message.
3. How is the fee calculated in the `resolve_spend_message` function?
- The fee is calculated by first creating a dummy message with the specified blockhash (if provided) and then calling the `get_fee_for_messages` function with an array containing the dummy message. If no blockhash is provided, the fee is set to 0 since it cannot be calculated offline.
