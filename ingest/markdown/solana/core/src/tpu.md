The `tpu` module implements the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), a multi-stage transaction processing pipeline in software. The TPU is responsible for processing transactions, verifying signatures, and broadcasting the transactions to the network. It consists of several stages, including the FetchStage, SigVerifyStage, BankingStage, ClusterInfoVoteListener, BroadcastStage, and other supporting stages.

The `TpuSockets` struct holds the various UDP sockets used for communication between the stages. The `Tpu` struct contains instances of the different stages and their respective threads.

The `Tpu::new()` function initializes the TPU with the necessary components, such as cluster information, PohRecorder, sockets, and other configurations. It sets up the FetchStage, which listens for incoming transactions, transaction forwards, and votes from the network. The StakedNodesUpdaterService is responsible for updating the staked nodes information.

The FindPacketSenderStakeStage is used to find the stake of the sender of a packet. Two instances of this stage are created, one for regular transactions and one for vote transactions. The TPU also spawns two QUIC servers for handling transactions and transaction forwards.

The SigVerifyStage is responsible for verifying the signatures of the transactions. Two instances of this stage are created, one for regular transactions and one for vote transactions. The BankingStage processes the transactions and updates the bank state. The ClusterInfoVoteListener listens for votes from the network and updates the vote tracker and bank forks.

The BroadcastStage is responsible for broadcasting the transactions to the network. The `Tpu::join()` function waits for all the stages and threads to complete their execution.

Here's an example of how the Tpu is used in the larger project:

```rust
let tpu = Tpu::new(
    &cluster_info,
    &poh_recorder,
    entry_receiver,
    retransmit_slots_receiver,
    sockets,
    &subscriptions,
    transaction_status_sender,
    &blockstore,
    &broadcast_type,
    &exit,
    shred_version,
    vote_tracker,
    bank_forks,
    verified_vote_sender,
    gossip_verified_vote_hash_sender,
    replay_vote_receiver,
    replay_vote_sender,
    bank_notification_sender,
    tpu_coalesce_ms,
    cluster_confirmed_slot_sender,
    &connection_cache,
    &keypair,
    log_messages_bytes_limit,
    &staked_nodes,
    shared_staked_nodes_overrides,
    banking_tracer,
    tracer_thread_hdl,
    tpu_enable_udp,
);

tpu.join()?;
```

This code snippet initializes a new Tpu instance with the required components and starts the TPU pipeline. After processing transactions, the Tpu instance is joined to wait for all stages to complete.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Tpu` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `Tpu` struct represents the Transaction Processing Unit, which is a multi-stage transaction processing pipeline in software. It contains various stages like fetch, sigverify, vote_sigverify, banking, cluster_info_vote_listener, broadcast, and others. The `Tpu::new()` method initializes a new TPU instance with the given parameters, and the `join()` method is used to join all the stages' threads.

2. **Question**: How does the TPU handle incoming transactions and votes?
   **Answer**: The TPU handles incoming transactions and votes through the `FetchStage`. It listens for transactions, transaction forwards, and votes on separate sockets, and forwards them to the appropriate channels for further processing. The transactions are then passed through the `SigVerifyStage` and `BankingStage`, while the votes are processed by the `VoteSigVerifyStage` and `ClusterInfoVoteListener`.

3. **Question**: How does the TPU handle staked and unstaked connections for QUIC?
   **Answer**: The TPU handles staked and unstaked connections for QUIC by using the `spawn_server()` function to create two separate QUIC servers for transactions and transaction forwards. The servers are configured with different connection limits for staked and unstaked nodes, using the `MAX_STAKED_CONNECTIONS`, `MAX_UNSTAKED_CONNECTIONS`, and `MAX_QUIC_CONNECTIONS_PER_PEER` constants. The `StakedNodesUpdaterService` is responsible for updating the staked nodes information.
