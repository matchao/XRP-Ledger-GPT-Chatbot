The `PohTimingReportService` module is responsible for receiving signals of relevant timing points during the processing of a slot, aggregating and reporting the result as datapoints. This module is located in the `solana/core/src/poh_timing_report_service.rs` file.

The `PohTimingReportService` struct has a `new` method that takes a `PohTimingReceiver` and an `Arc<AtomicBool>` as arguments. The `PohTimingReceiver` is a channel receiver that receives timing points from the blockstore and poh. The `Arc<AtomicBool>` is used to signal the thread to exit. The `new` method creates a new `PohTimingReporter` and a new thread that loops until the exit signal is received. The thread waits for timing points from the `PohTimingReceiver` and processes them using the `PohTimingReporter`. The `PohTimingReporter` is responsible for aggregating the timing points and reporting the result as datapoints.

The `PohTimingReportService` struct also has a `join` method that joins the thread.

The `test` module contains a test for the `PohTimingReportService`. The test creates a new `PohTimingReportService`, sends timing points to the `PohTimingReceiver`, signals the thread to exit, and joins the thread.

Here is an example of how to use the `PohTimingReportService`:

```rust
use solana_metrics::poh_timing_point::{PohTimingReceiver, SlotPohTimingInfo};
use solana_core::poh_timing_report_service::PohTimingReportService;
use std::{
    sync::{
        atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering},
        Arc,
    },
    thread,
};
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;

fn main() {
    let (poh_timing_point_sender, poh_timing_point_receiver) = unbounded();
    let exit = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
    let poh_timing_report_service = PohTimingReportService::new(poh_timing_point_receiver, &exit);

    let _ = poh_timing_point_sender.send(SlotPohTimingInfo::new_slot_start_poh_time_point(
        42, None, 100,
    ));
    let _ = poh_timing_point_sender.send(SlotPohTimingInfo::new_slot_end_poh_time_point(
        42, None, 200,
    ));
    let _ = poh_timing_point_sender.send(SlotPohTimingInfo::new_slot_full_poh_time_point(
        42, None, 150,
    ));

    exit.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
    poh_timing_report_service.join().expect("poh_timing_report_service completed");
}
```

In this example, a new `PohTimingReportService` is created with a `PohTimingReceiver` and an `Arc<AtomicBool>`. Timing points are sent to the `PohTimingReceiver`. The thread is signaled to exit and joined.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PohTimingReportService` module?
- The `PohTimingReportService` module receives signals of relevant timing points during the processing of a slot, aggregates and reports the result as datapoints.

2. What is the significance of the `POH_TIMING_RECEIVER_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS` constant?
- The `POH_TIMING_RECEIVER_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS` constant is the timeout duration to wait on the poh timing points from the channel.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_poh_timing_report_service` function in the `test` module?
- The `test_poh_timing_report_service` function tests the life cycle of the `PohTimingReportService` module by creating the service, sending `SlotPohTimingPoint`, and shutting down the service.
