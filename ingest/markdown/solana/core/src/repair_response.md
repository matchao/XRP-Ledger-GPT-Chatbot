The `repair_response.rs` file contains functions related to repairing data shreds in the Solana blockchain. The `repair_response_packet` function takes a `Blockstore`, a `Slot`, a `shred_index`, a destination `SocketAddr`, and a `Nonce` as input. It retrieves a data shred from the `Blockstore` using the `get_data_shred` method and creates a `Packet` using the `repair_response_packet_from_bytes` function. The `repair_response_packet_from_bytes` function takes a vector of bytes, a destination `SocketAddr`, and a `Nonce` as input. It creates a `Packet` and sets its size and destination address. It then copies the input bytes to the packet buffer and serializes the `Nonce` into the remaining buffer space. The `nonce` function extracts the `Nonce` from a `Packet` if it exists.

These functions are used to repair missing or corrupted data shreds in the Solana blockchain. When a node detects a missing or corrupted data shred, it sends a request to other nodes in the network to repair the shred. The other nodes respond with a `Packet` containing the requested data shred. The `repair_response_packet` function is used to create the response `Packet` from the retrieved data shred. The `nonce` function is used to extract the `Nonce` from the response `Packet` to verify that it came from a valid source.

The `test` module contains a unit test for the `run_test_sigverify_shred_cpu_repair` function, which tests the `verify_shred_cpu` function that verifies the signature of a data shred. This test ensures that the `repair_response_packet_from_bytes` function creates a valid `Packet` that can be verified by the `verify_shred_cpu` function.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `repair_response_packet` function?
   - The `repair_response_packet` function takes in a `Blockstore`, a `Slot`, a `shred_index`, a `SocketAddr`, and a `Nonce`, and returns an optional `Packet` that is constructed from a data shred retrieved from the `Blockstore`.
2. What is the purpose of the `repair_response_packet_from_bytes` function?
   - The `repair_response_packet_from_bytes` function takes in a vector of bytes, a `SocketAddr`, and a `Nonce`, and returns an optional `Packet` that is constructed from the input bytes and the provided `SocketAddr` and `Nonce`.
3. What is the purpose of the `nonce` function?
   - The `nonce` function takes in a `Packet` and returns an optional `Nonce` that is extracted from the packet data. It is used to retrieve nonces that are attached to both repair and ancestor hashes responses.
