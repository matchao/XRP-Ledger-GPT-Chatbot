The `ledger_metric_report_service` is a module that periodically reports metrics related to the ledger store. The purpose of this module is to provide information about the performance and health of the ledger store to the user. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the ledger store and to identify any issues that may be affecting its performance.

The module defines a struct called `LedgerMetricReportService` that contains a single field called `t_cf_metric`. The `t_cf_metric` field is a `JoinHandle` that is used to spawn a new thread that periodically reports the metrics related to the ledger store.

The `new` method of the `LedgerMetricReportService` struct takes two arguments: `blockstore` and `exit`. The `blockstore` argument is an `Arc` that contains a reference to the `Blockstore` struct. The `exit` argument is an `Arc` that contains a reference to an `AtomicBool` that is used to signal the thread to exit.

The `new` method creates a new thread using the `Builder` struct. The thread is named "solRocksCfMtrcs" and is spawned using a closure that contains a loop. The loop checks the value of the `exit_signal` `AtomicBool` and exits if it is set to true. Otherwise, it sleeps for a period of time specified by the `BLOCKSTORE_METRICS_REPORT_PERIOD_MILLIS` constant and then calls the `submit_rocksdb_cf_metrics_for_all_cfs` method of the `blockstore` object. This method submits the metrics related to the ledger store to the user.

The `join` method of the `LedgerMetricReportService` struct waits for the thread to complete and returns a `thread::Result`.

Overall, the `ledger_metric_report_service` module provides a way to periodically report metrics related to the ledger store. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the ledger store and to identify any issues that may be affecting its performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a service that periodically reports metrics for a ledger store.

2. What is the significance of the `BLOCKSTORE_METRICS_REPORT_PERIOD_MILLIS` constant?
   - This constant determines how often blockstore metrics are reported under the `LedgerMetricReportService`.

3. What is the `submit_rocksdb_cf_metrics_for_all_cfs` function and where does it come from?
   - This function is called to submit RocksDB column family metrics for all column families in the blockstore. It comes from the `Blockstore` struct defined in the `solana_ledger::blockstore` module.
