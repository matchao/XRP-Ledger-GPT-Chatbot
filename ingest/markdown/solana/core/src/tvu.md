The `tvu` module implements the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), a multi-stage transaction validation pipeline in the Solana project. The TVU is responsible for receiving messages from a leader in the network, processing the transactions on the bank state, and managing various services related to transaction validation.

The `Tvu` struct contains several components, such as `ShredFetchStage`, `RetransmitStage`, `WindowService`, `ClusterSlotsService`, `ReplayStage`, `LedgerCleanupService`, `CostUpdateService`, `VotingService`, `WarmQuicCacheService`, `DropBankService`, and `DuplicateShredListener`. These components work together to handle various aspects of transaction validation, such as fetching shreds, retransmitting data, managing cluster slots, replaying transactions, cleaning up the ledger, updating costs, voting, and handling duplicate shreds.

The `Tvu` struct provides a `new` function to create a new instance of the TVU. This function takes several arguments, such as the vote account, authorized voter keypairs, bank forks, cluster info, sockets, blockstore, ledger signal receiver, RPC subscriptions, PoH recorder, tower storage, leader schedule cache, exit flag, block commitment cache, and various configuration options. The function initializes all the components of the TVU and returns a `Result<Self, String>`.

The `Tvu` struct also provides a `join` function that waits for all the components to finish their execution. This function is useful for gracefully shutting down the TVU when the exit flag is set.

In the `tests` submodule, there is a test called `test_tvu_exit` that demonstrates how to create a new instance of the TVU, set the exit flag, and wait for the TVU to finish its execution using the `join` function.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Tvu` struct and how does it interact with other components in the Solana project?
   **Answer**: The `Tvu` struct represents the Transaction Validation Unit, which is a multi-stage transaction validation pipeline in software. It receives messages from a leader in the network and processes the transactions on the bank state. It interacts with various components like `ShredFetchStage`, `RetransmitStage`, `WindowService`, `ClusterSlotsService`, `ReplayStage`, and others to perform its functions.

2. **Question**: What are the different sockets used in the `TvuSockets` struct and what are their roles?
   **Answer**: The `TvuSockets` struct contains five sockets: `fetch`, `repair`, `retransmit`, `forwards`, and `ancestor_hashes_requests`. The `fetch` socket is used for fetching shreds, the `repair` socket is used for repairing missing shreds, the `retransmit` socket is used for retransmitting shreds, the `forwards` socket is used for forwarding shreds, and the `ancestor_hashes_requests` socket is used for requesting ancestor hashes.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TvuConfig` struct and how is it used in the `Tvu` struct?
   **Answer**: The `TvuConfig` struct holds various configuration options for the `Tvu` struct, such as `max_ledger_shreds`, `shred_version`, `repair_validators`, `repair_whitelist`, `wait_for_vote_to_start_leader`, and `replay_slots_concurrently`. These options are used to customize the behavior of the `Tvu` struct during its initialization and operation.
