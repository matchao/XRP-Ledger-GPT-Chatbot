The `voting_service.rs` file contains the implementation of the `VotingService` struct and the `VoteOp` enum. The `VotingService` struct is responsible for handling incoming vote operations and sending them to the appropriate target address. The `VoteOp` enum defines two types of vote operations: `PushVote` and `RefreshVote`.

The `PushVote` operation is used to push a new vote transaction to the network. It contains a transaction, a list of tower slots, and a saved tower version. The `RefreshVote` operation is used to refresh an existing vote transaction. It contains a transaction and the last voted slot.

The `VotingService` struct has a `new` method that takes in a `vote_receiver` channel, a `cluster_info` object, a `poh_recorder` object, a `tower_storage` object, and a `bank_forks` object. It creates a new thread that listens for incoming vote operations on the `vote_receiver` channel. When a vote operation is received, it calls the `handle_vote` method to handle the operation.

The `handle_vote` method takes in the `cluster_info`, `poh_recorder`, `tower_storage`, `vote_op`, and `send_to_tpu_vote_port` parameters. It first checks if the vote operation is a `PushVote` operation and if so, it saves the tower version to the `tower_storage` object. It then calls the `next_leader_tpu_vote` or `next_leader_tpu` method from the `next_leader` module to get the target address for the vote transaction. Finally, it sends the vote transaction to the target address using the `send_transaction` method of the `cluster_info` object.

The `handle_vote` method also handles the `RefreshVote` operation by calling the `refresh_vote` method of the `cluster_info` object.

Overall, the `VotingService` struct and the `VoteOp` enum are used to handle vote operations in the Solana network. The `VotingService` struct listens for incoming vote operations and sends them to the appropriate target address using the `cluster_info` object. The `VoteOp` enum defines the two types of vote operations that can be handled: `PushVote` and `RefreshVote`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VotingService` struct and how is it used?
- The `VotingService` struct is used to handle incoming vote operations received through a channel. It spawns a new thread to handle these operations and calls the `handle_vote` function to process each operation.

2. What is the `VoteOp` enum and what are its variants?
- The `VoteOp` enum represents the different types of vote operations that can be received by the `VotingService`. Its variants are `PushVote`, which includes a transaction, a list of tower slots, and a saved tower version, and `RefreshVote`, which includes a transaction and the last voted slot.

3. What is the purpose of the `handle_vote` function and what does it do?
- The `handle_vote` function processes a single vote operation by storing the saved tower version (if the operation is a `PushVote`), determining the next leader TPU to send the transaction to, and sending the transaction to that TPU. It also updates the cluster's vote state based on the type of vote operation.
