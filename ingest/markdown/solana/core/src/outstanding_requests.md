The `OutstandingRequests` struct is used to manage requests that have been sent out but have not yet received a response. It uses an LRU cache to store the requests and their associated metadata, including a nonce (a random number used to identify the request), the expected number of responses, and the expiration time of the request. 

The `add_request` method is used to add a new request to the cache. It takes a `RequestResponse` object, which is a trait that defines a request and its associated response type. It generates a new nonce and stores the request along with its metadata in the cache. The method returns the nonce, which can be used to identify the request later.

The `register_response` method is used to register a response to a previously sent request. It takes the nonce of the request, the response, and the current time. If the nonce is found in the cache and the response is valid (as determined by the `verify_response` method of the request), the method decrements the expected number of responses and returns the result of calling the `success_fn` closure with the request as an argument. If the expected number of responses has reached zero, the request is removed from the cache. If the nonce is not found in the cache or the response is invalid, the method returns `None`.

The `DEFAULT_REQUEST_EXPIRATION_MS` constant defines the default expiration time for requests in milliseconds.

The `RequestStatus` struct is used to store the metadata associated with a request.

The `tests` module contains unit tests for the `OutstandingRequests` struct.

Overall, the `OutstandingRequests` struct provides a way to manage outstanding requests and their associated responses in a cache. It can be used in the larger project to ensure that responses are received in a timely manner and to handle cases where responses are not received or are invalid.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OutstandingRequests` struct?
- The `OutstandingRequests` struct is used to keep track of requests that have been sent and are awaiting responses.

2. What is the significance of the `nonce` value?
- The `nonce` value is a randomly generated number that is used to identify a specific request and its corresponding responses.

3. What happens if a response is received after the expiration time for a request?
- If a response is received after the expiration time for a request, the request status is removed and the response is ignored to prevent late responses from being accepted.
