The `committer.rs` file contains the implementation of the `Committer` struct, which is responsible for committing transactions to the ledger. The `Committer` struct has a `transaction_status_sender` field that is used to send transaction status updates to clients, and a `replay_vote_sender` field that is used to send votes during the replay stage.

The `Committer` struct has a `commit_transactions` method that takes in a `TransactionBatch` and a number of other parameters, and returns a tuple containing the commit time in microseconds and a vector of `CommitTransactionDetails`. The `commit_transactions` method commits the transactions in the `TransactionBatch` to the ledger by calling the `commit_transactions` method of the `Bank` struct. It also sends transaction status updates to clients by calling the `collect_balances_and_send_status_batch` method.

The `collect_balances_and_send_status_batch` method collects the balances of the accounts involved in the transactions and sends transaction status updates to clients. It uses the `collect_balances` method of the `Bank` struct to collect the balances of the accounts, and the `collect_token_balances` function to collect the token balances of the accounts.

The `PreBalanceInfo` struct is used to store the pre-transaction balances of the accounts. It has a `native` field that stores the pre-transaction balances of the native accounts, and a `token` field that stores the pre-transaction balances of the token accounts. It also has a `mint_decimals` field that stores the decimal places of the mints.

The `CommitTransactionDetails` enum is used to represent the details of a committed transaction. It has two variants: `Committed` and `NotCommitted`. The `Committed` variant contains the number of compute units used by the transaction.

Overall, the `Committer` struct is an important component of the Solana project as it is responsible for committing transactions to the ledger and sending transaction status updates to clients.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Committer` struct and its methods?
- The `Committer` struct is responsible for committing transactions to a bank. Its methods include `commit_transactions` which takes in a batch of transactions, executes them, and sends their status to a transaction status sender if enabled.

2. What is the purpose of the `PreBalanceInfo` struct and its fields?
- The `PreBalanceInfo` struct is used to store pre-transaction balances and token balances for a batch of transactions. Its fields include `native` which stores pre-transaction native balances, `token` which stores pre-transaction token balances, and `mint_decimals` which stores the decimal precision of token mints.

3. What is the purpose of the `CommitTransactionDetails` enum and where is it used?
- The `CommitTransactionDetails` enum is used to indicate whether a transaction was successfully committed or not, and if so, how many compute units were used. It is used in the `commit_transactions` method to generate a vector of `CommitTransactionDetails` for each transaction in the batch.
