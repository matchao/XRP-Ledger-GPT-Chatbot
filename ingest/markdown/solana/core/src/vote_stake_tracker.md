The `VoteStakeTracker` struct in `vote_stake_tracker.rs` is used to track the total stake of votes for a given epoch. It keeps track of the total stake and the set of pubkeys that have voted. The `add_vote_pubkey` method is used to add a new vote to the tracker. It takes in the pubkey of the voter, the stake of the vote, the total stake for the epoch, and a list of thresholds to check. It returns a tuple of two values: a vector of boolean values indicating whether each threshold was newly reached by adding the stake of the input pubkey, and a boolean indicating whether the vote is new or has been seen before.

The `add_vote_pubkey` method first checks if the pubkey is new by checking if it is already in the set of voted pubkeys. If it is new, it adds the pubkey to the set and updates the total stake by adding the stake of the vote. It then calculates whether each threshold in the input list is newly reached by comparing the old stake to the new stake after adding the vote. If the pubkey is not new, it returns a vector of false values for each threshold and sets the `is_new` value to false.

The `voted` method returns a reference to the set of voted pubkeys, and the `stake` method returns the total stake.

This code is used in the larger Solana project to keep track of the total stake of votes for a given epoch. It is used in the consensus algorithm to determine whether a block has reached a supermajority threshold of votes. The `test_add_vote_pubkey` function in the `test` module tests the `add_vote_pubkey` method by adding votes to the tracker and checking whether the correct thresholds are reached. For example, it checks whether the supermajority threshold is reached when the voted stake is 70%.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VoteStakeTracker` struct and its methods?
- The `VoteStakeTracker` struct is used to track the total stake of votes for a given epoch. The `add_vote_pubkey` method adds a new vote pubkey to the tracker and returns a tuple indicating whether any new thresholds have been reached and whether the vote is new. The `voted` and `stake` methods return the set of voted pubkeys and the total stake, respectively.

2. What is the significance of the `thresholds_to_check` parameter in the `add_vote_pubkey` method?
- The `thresholds_to_check` parameter is an array of thresholds to check for whether they have been newly reached by adding the stake of the input `vote_pubkey`. The method returns a vector of booleans indicating which thresholds have been newly reached.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_add_vote_pubkey` function in the `test` module?
- The `test_add_vote_pubkey` function tests the `add_vote_pubkey` method of the `VoteStakeTracker` struct. It adds a series of vote pubkeys to the tracker and checks whether the correct thresholds have been newly reached and whether the stake has been updated correctly.
