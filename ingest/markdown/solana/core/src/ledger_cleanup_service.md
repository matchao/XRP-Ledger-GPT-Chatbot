The `ledger_cleanup_service` module in Solana is responsible for managing the disk space usage of the ledger by removing older ledger data. It does this by counting the number of live data shreds in the ledger, which can be done quickly and should have a fairly stable correlation to the actual byte count. Once the shred count reaches a threshold, the service starts removing data in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

The `LedgerCleanupService` struct contains a `JoinHandle` for the cleanup thread, which is created in the `new` function. The `new` function takes a `Receiver` for new root slots, a shared `Blockstore`, a maximum number of ledger shreds, and an `AtomicBool` for signaling the service to exit. The cleanup thread runs in a loop, checking for new roots and initiating a cleanup if the last cleanup was at least `DEFAULT_PURGE_SLOT_INTERVAL` slots ago.

The `cleanup_ledger` function checks for new roots and initiates a cleanup if the last cleanup was at least `purge_interval` slots ago. A cleanup will no-op if the ledger already has fewer than `max_ledger_shreds`; otherwise, the cleanup will purge enough slots to get the ledger size below `max_ledger_shreds`.

The `find_slots_to_clean` function is a helper function that returns a tuple of three elements: a boolean value indicating whether there are any slots to clean, the lowest slot to purge, and the total estimated number of shreds before the root. If the boolean value is true, then the `cleanup_ledger` function will proceed with the ledger cleanup.

Example usage:

```rust
let ledger_cleanup_service = LedgerCleanupService::new(
    new_root_receiver,
    blockstore,
    DEFAULT_MAX_LEDGER_SHREDS,
    &exit,
);
```

In this example, a new `LedgerCleanupService` is created with the specified parameters. The service will then run in the background, cleaning up the ledger as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `LedgerCleanupService` and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `LedgerCleanupService` is responsible for dropping older ledger data to limit disk space usage. It works by counting the number of live data shreds in the ledger, which can be done quickly and should have a fairly stable correlation to actual bytes. Once the shred count reaches a threshold, the service begins removing data in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

2. **Question**: How are the default values for `DEFAULT_MAX_LEDGER_SHREDS`, `DEFAULT_MIN_MAX_LEDGER_SHREDS`, and `DEFAULT_PURGE_SLOT_INTERVAL` determined?
   **Answer**: The default values are chosen to balance disk space usage and operational requirements. `DEFAULT_MAX_LEDGER_SHREDS` is set to 200 million to keep the RocksDB size under 400GB, allowing enough time for a validator to download a snapshot and boot from it. `DEFAULT_MIN_MAX_LEDGER_SHREDS` is set to 50 million, allowing for about 3.5 days at idle or 1 hour at 50k load, around 100GB. `DEFAULT_PURGE_SLOT_INTERVAL` is set to 512 to avoid purging too often and starving other blockstore users.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `find_slots_to_clean` function and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `find_slots_to_clean` function is a helper function for `cleanup_ledger` that determines whether to clean up the ledger and which slots to clean. It returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean value indicating whether there are any slots to clean, the lowest slot to purge (any slot older or equal to this will be cleaned up), and the total estimated number of shreds before the root.
