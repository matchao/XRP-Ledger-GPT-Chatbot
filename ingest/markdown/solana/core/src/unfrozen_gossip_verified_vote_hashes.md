The `UnfrozenGossipVerifiedVoteHashes` struct is used to keep track of verified votes for unfrozen banks in the Solana blockchain. It contains a `BTreeMap` called `votes_per_slot` that maps a slot to a `HashMap` of vote hashes to a vector of public keys. The purpose of this struct is to record votes for unfrozen banks in case they get frozen later. 

The `add_vote` method is used to add a new vote to the `votes_per_slot` map. If the bank is frozen, the `latest_validator_votes_for_frozen_banks` struct is updated. If the vote is not added to `latest_validator_votes_for_frozen_banks` and the vote slot is greater than or equal to the latest frozen vote slot, the vote is added to `votes_per_slot`. 

The `set_root` method is used to clean up `votes_per_slot` based on new roots. It splits off all entries in `votes_per_slot` that are less than the new root and updates `votes_per_slot` to only contain entries greater than or equal to the new root. 

The `remove_slot_hash` method is used to remove a slot hash from `votes_per_slot`. It returns the vector of public keys associated with the hash if it exists in `votes_per_slot`. If the `HashMap` associated with the slot becomes empty, it will be removed by `set_root()` later. 

The `tests` module contains a unit test for the `add_vote` method. It tests two cases: frozen banks should not be added, and other non-frozen banks should be added in case they get frozen later. 

Overall, the `UnfrozenGossipVerifiedVoteHashes` struct is an important component of the Solana blockchain's consensus mechanism. It ensures that verified votes for unfrozen banks are recorded and can be used later if the bank gets frozen.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UnfrozenGossipVerifiedVoteHashes` struct?
- The `UnfrozenGossipVerifiedVoteHashes` struct is used to keep track of verified votes that have not yet been frozen.

2. What is the significance of the `latest_validator_votes_for_frozen_banks` parameter in the `add_vote` function?
- The `latest_validator_votes_for_frozen_banks` parameter is used to update the latest validator votes for frozen banks if a newer vote is seen through gossip.

3. What is the purpose of the `set_root` function?
- The `set_root` function is used to clean up the `votes_per_slot` map based on new roots. It removes all entries with keys less than the new root.
