The `progress_map.rs` file in the Solana project is responsible for tracking the progress of forks in the network. It maintains a `ProgressMap` struct, which is a wrapper around a `HashMap` that maps a slot to its corresponding `ForkProgress`. The `ForkProgress` struct contains information about the fork's status, statistics, and propagation information.

The `ForkProgress` struct has several fields, including `is_dead`, `fork_stats`, `propagated_stats`, `replay_stats`, `replay_progress`, `retransmit_info`, `num_blocks_on_fork`, and `num_dropped_blocks_on_fork`. These fields help track the progress of a fork and determine if it has reached a supermajority confirmation or if it needs to be retransmitted.

The `ForkStats` struct contains information about the fork's weight, total stake, block height, lockout intervals, and other related data. The `PropagatedStats` struct tracks the propagated validators, their stake, and other related information.

The `ProgressMap` struct provides several methods to interact with the underlying `HashMap`, such as `insert`, `get_propagated_stats`, `get_fork_stats`, `get_retransmit_info`, and others. These methods allow the caller to insert new forks, retrieve information about existing forks, and update the status of forks.

The `ReplaySlotStats` struct is used to report various statistics related to the replay of a slot, such as the time taken to fetch entries, verify transactions, and execute batches. The `report_stats` method is used to log these statistics using the `datapoint_info!` and `datapoint_trace!` macros.

In summary, the `progress_map.rs` file is responsible for tracking the progress of forks in the Solana network, providing methods to insert, update, and retrieve information about forks, and reporting statistics related to the replay of slots.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ForkProgress` struct and how is it used in the `ProgressMap`?
   **Answer**: The `ForkProgress` struct is used to store information about the progress of a specific fork in the ledger, including its status, statistics, and other related data. It is used in the `ProgressMap` to associate each slot with its corresponding `ForkProgress` information.

2. **Question**: How does the `PropagatedStats` struct track the propagation of validator votes and node pubkeys?
   **Answer**: The `PropagatedStats` struct maintains two hash sets, `propagated_validators` and `propagated_node_ids`, to track the unique validator vote pubkeys and node pubkeys that have been propagated. It also keeps track of the total stake of propagated validators in `propagated_validators_stake`.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `RetransmitInfo` struct and how is it used in the `ForkProgress` struct?
   **Answer**: The `RetransmitInfo` struct is used to store information about the retransmission of a fork, including the time of the last retry and the number of retry iterations. It is used in the `ForkProgress` struct to manage the retransmission behavior for a specific fork.
