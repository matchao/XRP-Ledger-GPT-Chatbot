The `ReadWriteAccountSet` struct in `solana/core/src/read_write_account_set.rs` is responsible for managing account locks for a batch of transactions in the Solana project. It maintains two sets of account locks: `read_set` and `write_set`. The `read_set` contains accounts that are locked for read operations, while the `write_set` contains accounts that are locked for write operations.

The struct provides several methods to manage account locks:

- `check_static_account_locks(&self, message: &VersionedMessage) -> bool`: This method checks if the account locks for a transaction message are available. It returns true if all account locks are available and false otherwise.

- `try_locking(&mut self, message: &SanitizedMessage) -> bool`: This method attempts to lock all account locks for a sanitized message. If all account locks are available, it locks them and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

- `clear(&mut self)`: This method clears both the read and write sets.

- `check_sanitized_message_account_locks(&self, message: &SanitizedMessage) -> bool`: This method checks if the account locks for a sanitized message are available. It returns true if all account locks are available and false otherwise.

- `add_sanitized_message_account_locks(&mut self, message: &SanitizedMessage)`: This method inserts the read and write locks for a sanitized message.

- `can_read(&self, pubkey: &Pubkey) -> bool`: This method checks if an account can be read-locked.

- `can_write(&self, pubkey: &Pubkey) -> bool`: This method checks if an account can be write-locked.

- `add_read(&mut self, pubkey: &Pubkey)`: This method adds an account to the read-set. It should only be called after `can_read()` returns true.

- `add_write(&mut self, pubkey: &Pubkey)`: This method adds an account to the write-set. It should only be called after `can_write()` returns true.

The module also includes a set of tests to ensure the correct functionality of the `ReadWriteAccountSet` struct and its methods.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ReadWriteAccountSet` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer:** The `ReadWriteAccountSet` struct is a wrapper to manage account locks for a batch of transactions. It maintains separate sets for read and write locks and provides methods to check, lock, and clear account locks for transaction messages.

2. **Question:** How does the `try_locking` method work and when should it be used?
   **Answer:** The `try_locking` method checks if all account locks for a given sanitized message are available and if so, locks them. It returns true if all account locks are available and false otherwise. This method should be used when attempting to lock accounts for a transaction message while ensuring that no conflicts arise with other locked accounts.

3. **Question:** What is the difference between the `check_static_account_locks` and `check_sanitized_message_account_locks` methods?
   **Answer:** The `check_static_account_locks` method checks if the account locks for a given versioned message are available, while the `check_sanitized_message_account_locks` method checks if the account locks for a given sanitized message are available. The main difference is the type of message they operate on: `check_static_account_locks` works with `VersionedMessage`, while `check_sanitized_message_account_locks` works with `SanitizedMessage`.
