The `fork_choice.rs` file contains code related to the fork choice rule, which is a key component of Solana's consensus algorithm. The fork choice rule determines which fork of the blockchain to follow when there are multiple competing forks. The purpose of this code is to implement the fork choice rule and provide methods for computing bank statistics, selecting forks, and marking forks as valid or invalid candidates.

The `SelectVoteAndResetForkResult` struct contains information about the selected vote bank, reset bank, and any heaviest fork failures. The `ForkChoice` trait defines methods for computing bank statistics, selecting forks, and marking forks as valid or invalid candidates. The `compute_bank_stats` method computes statistics for a given bank, including the latest validator votes for frozen banks. The `select_forks` method selects the heaviest overall bank and the heaviest bank on the same fork as the last vote. The `mark_fork_invalid_candidate` method marks a fork as an invalid candidate, while the `mark_fork_valid_candidate` method marks a fork as a valid candidate and returns any newly duplicate confirmed ancestors of the valid slot.

This code is used in the larger Solana project to ensure that the network reaches consensus on the state of the blockchain. By implementing the fork choice rule, Solana is able to handle situations where multiple forks of the blockchain exist and determine which fork to follow. This is important for maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain. For example, if a malicious actor attempts to create a fork of the blockchain, the fork choice rule can help ensure that the legitimate chain is followed and the malicious fork is rejected.

Here is an example of how the `select_forks` method might be used in the larger Solana project:

```
let frozen_banks = vec![bank1, bank2, bank3];
let tower = Tower::new();
let progress = ProgressMap::new();
let ancestors = HashMap::new();
let bank_forks = RwLock::new(BankForks::new(bank1));
let fork_choice = ForkChoiceImpl::new();

let (heaviest_bank, heaviest_same_fork) = fork_choice.select_forks(
    &frozen_banks,
    &tower,
    &progress,
    &ancestors,
    &bank_forks,
);

// Use the heaviest bank and heaviest same fork for further processing
```

In this example, the `select_forks` method is called with a list of frozen banks, a tower, a progress map, a map of ancestors, and a bank fork. The method returns the heaviest overall bank and the heaviest bank on the same fork as the last vote. These banks can then be used for further processing in the Solana project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ForkChoice` trait?
- The `ForkChoice` trait defines methods for computing bank statistics, selecting forks, and marking forks as valid or invalid candidates.

2. What is the `SelectVoteAndResetForkResult` struct used for?
- The `SelectVoteAndResetForkResult` struct is used to return the results of selecting a vote and resetting a fork. It contains an optional tuple of the vote bank and switch fork decision, an optional reset bank, and a vector of heaviest fork failures.

3. What is the `select_forks` method used for?
- The `select_forks` method is used to select the heaviest overall bank and the heaviest bank on the same fork as the last vote, based on frozen banks, a tower, progress map, ancestors, and bank forks. It returns a tuple of the selected banks.
