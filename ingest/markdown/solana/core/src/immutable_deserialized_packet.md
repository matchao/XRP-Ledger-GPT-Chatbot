The `immutable_deserialized_packet.rs` file contains the implementation of the `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` struct and its methods. This struct represents a deserialized packet that contains a transaction and its metadata. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to deserialize packets into transactions, compute the blake3 hash of transaction messages, and verify secp256k1 instructions.

The `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` struct has several fields, including the original packet, the sanitized versioned transaction, the message hash, a boolean flag indicating whether the transaction is a simple vote, and the priority details of the transaction. The `new` method is used to create a new `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` instance from a `Packet` instance and an optional `TransactionPriorityDetails` instance. This method deserializes the packet into a versioned transaction, sanitizes the transaction, computes the message hash, and sets the priority details. If the prioritization fails, the method returns an error.

The `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` struct also has several getter methods, including `original_packet`, `transaction`, `message_hash`, `is_simple_vote`, `priority`, and `compute_unit_limit`. These methods return the corresponding fields of the struct.

The `build_sanitized_transaction` method is used to build a sanitized transaction from the `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` instance. This method takes a `FeatureSet` instance, a boolean flag indicating whether to include only vote transactions, and an `AddressLoader` instance as arguments. If the packet is not a vote transaction and the `votes_only` flag is set, the method returns `None`. Otherwise, it creates a new `SanitizedTransaction` instance from the sanitized versioned transaction, the message hash, the simple vote flag, and the address loader. It then verifies the precompiles and returns the sanitized transaction.

The `packet_message` function is a helper function that reads the transaction message from packet data. It takes a `Packet` instance as an argument and returns a slice of bytes representing the transaction message.

The `tests` module contains a unit test for the `simple_deserialized_packet` function. This test creates a new transfer transaction, creates a packet from the transaction, and creates a new `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` instance from the packet. The test asserts that the result is an `Ok` value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` struct?
   
   The `ImmutableDeserializedPacket` struct represents a deserialized packet containing a sanitized transaction and its associated metadata, such as the transaction message hash and priority details.

2. What errors can occur during the deserialization process, and how are they handled?
   
   Errors that can occur during the deserialization process include short vector deserialization failures, general deserialization errors, signature overflow errors, sanitization errors, prioritization failures, and vote transaction errors. These errors are handled by returning a `DeserializedPacketError` enum variant that corresponds to the specific error type.

3. What is the purpose of the `build_sanitized_transaction` method, and what does it do?
   
   The `build_sanitized_transaction` method deserializes a packet into a sanitized transaction, computes the blake3 hash of the transaction message, and verifies secp256k1 instructions. It also checks if the packet contains a simple vote transaction and if the `votes_only` flag is set, and returns `None` if either condition is true. Finally, it returns the sanitized transaction if all checks pass.
