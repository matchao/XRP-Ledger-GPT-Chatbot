The `broadcast_duplicates_run.rs` file is part of the Solana project and implements the `BroadcastDuplicatesRun` struct and its associated methods. This module is responsible for broadcasting duplicate shreds to create a cluster partition, which is a technique used to test the network's ability to handle conflicting versions of the same slot.

The `BroadcastDuplicatesRun` struct contains fields such as `config`, `current_slot`, `next_shred_index`, `next_code_index`, `shred_version`, `recent_blockhash`, `prev_entry_hash`, `num_slots_broadcasted`, `cluster_nodes_cache`, `original_last_data_shreds`, `partition_last_data_shreds`, and `reed_solomon_cache`. The `new` method is used to create a new instance of the struct.

The `BroadcastDuplicatesRun` struct implements the `BroadcastRun` trait, which has three methods: `run`, `transmit`, and `record`. The `run` method is responsible for pulling entries from the banking stage, converting them to shreds, and broadcasting them to the network. It also handles the special case of the last shred to cause a partition. The `transmit` method creates a cluster partition based on the stake and broadcasts the data to the appropriate nodes. The `record` method receives shreds and inserts them into the blockstore.

An example of how this module is used in the larger project is when a leader node wants to broadcast duplicate shreds to create a cluster partition. The leader node would create a new instance of `BroadcastDuplicatesRun` and call the `run` method to start the process. The `transmit` and `record` methods would then be used to send the shreds to the appropriate nodes and store them in the blockstore, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `BroadcastDuplicatesRun` struct and how does it relate to the `BroadcastDuplicatesConfig` struct?
   
   **Answer**: The `BroadcastDuplicatesRun` struct is used to manage the state and behavior of the broadcast stage for handling duplicate shreds. It contains a `BroadcastDuplicatesConfig` struct, which holds configuration settings for the broadcast stage, such as the stake partition value.

2. **Question**: How does the `run` method work, and what is the significance
