The `poh_timing_reporter` module in the Solana project implements structs for recording and reporting the timing of events during the processing of a slot by the validator. The module contains two structs: `SlotPohTimestamp` and `PohTimingReporter`.

`SlotPohTimestamp` is a struct that records the timing of events during the processing of a slot. It has three fields: `start_time`, `end_time`, and `full_time`. These fields represent the start time of the slot from the Proof of History (PoH), the end time of the slot from PoH, and the last shred received time from the block producer, respectively. The struct also has methods for updating the timing points, checking if the timing points of all events are received, and reporting the timing for a slot.

`PohTimingReporter` is a struct that manages and reports the timing of events for incoming slots. It has two fields: `slot_timestamps` and `last_root_slot`. `slot_timestamps` is a storage map of `SlotPohTimestamp` per slot, and `last_root_slot` is the last root slot. The struct has methods for processing incoming `PohTimingPoint`s from the channel, checking if `PohTiming` is complete for the slot, and returning the count of `slot_timestamps` in tracking.

The module also contains tests for the `PohTimingReporter` and `SlotPohTimestamp` structs. The tests cover scenarios such as processing `PohTimingPoint`s out of order, processing `PohTimingPoint`s that are never complete, and testing the `SlotPohTimestamp`'s `fmt::Display` trait.

Overall, the `poh_timing_reporter` module is an important part of the Solana project as it provides a way to record and report the timing of events during the processing of a slot. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the validator and improve the overall efficiency of the Solana network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PohTimingReporter` struct and how does it work?
- The `PohTimingReporter` struct manages and reports the timing of events for incoming slots. It stores a `HashMap` of `SlotPohTimestamp` structs for each slot, and updates them with timing points as they are received. When a `SlotPohTimestamp` is complete (i.e. all timing points have been received), it reports the timing data using `datapoint_info!` from the `solana_metrics` crate.
2. What is the purpose of the `SlotPohTimestamp` struct and what data does it store?
- The `SlotPohTimestamp` struct records timing of the events during the processing of a slot by the validator. It stores the start time, end time, and last shred received time from the block producer for a given slot.
3. What is the purpose of the `is_complete` method in the `SlotPohTimestamp` struct?
- The `is_complete` method returns `true` if the timing points of all events (start, end, and full) have been received for a given `SlotPohTimestamp`.
