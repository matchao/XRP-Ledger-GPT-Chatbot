The `cluster_nodes.rs` file in the Solana project contains code for simulating a cluster of nodes and testing the retransmission of data between them. The purpose of this code is to benchmark the performance of the `get_retransmit_peers` function in the `ClusterNodes` struct, which is responsible for selecting a set of nodes to retransmit data to in order to ensure that all nodes in the cluster have the same data.

The `make_cluster_nodes` function generates a set of `ContactInfo` objects and creates a `ClusterNodes` instance from them. The `get_retransmit_peers_deterministic` function then generates a set of simulated `Shred` objects and calls the `get_retransmit_peers` function on the `ClusterNodes` instance to determine which nodes should receive the data. This process is repeated multiple times in the `get_retransmit_peers_deterministic_wrapper` function, which is called by the benchmark tests.

The benchmark tests themselves (`bench_get_retransmit_peers_deterministic_unstaked_ratio_1_2` and `bench_get_retransmit_peers_deterministic_unstaked_ratio_1_32`) call the `get_retransmit_peers_deterministic_wrapper` function with different `unstaked_ratio` values to test the performance of the `get_retransmit_peers` function under different conditions.

Overall, this code is used to test and optimize the performance of the retransmission process in the Solana cluster. By simulating a cluster of nodes and generating simulated data, the code can determine which nodes should receive the data and how quickly the data can be transmitted. This information can then be used to optimize the retransmission process and improve the overall performance of the Solana cluster.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is for benchmarking the `get_retransmit_peers_deterministic` function in the `ClusterNodes` module of the Solana core library.
2. What external crates are being used in this code?
   - This code is using the `test` and `rand` crates.
3. What is the significance of the `unstaked_ratio` parameter in the `get_retransmit_peers_deterministic_wrapper` function?
   - The `unstaked_ratio` parameter is used to specify the ratio of unstaked nodes in the test cluster that is created for benchmarking. It is an optional parameter that defaults to `None`.
