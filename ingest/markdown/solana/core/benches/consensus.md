The `consensus.rs` file in the Solana project contains two benchmark tests for the `Tower` struct, which is a component of the consensus algorithm used in Solana's blockchain. The `Tower` struct is responsible for tracking the voting history of validators in the network and determining the current leader of the network.

The first benchmark test, `bench_save_tower`, measures the time it takes to save a `Tower` instance to disk using the `FileTowerStorage` implementation. The test creates a temporary directory using the `TempDir` crate, initializes a `Tower` instance with a default `Pubkey`, a new `Keypair`, and a `Bank` instance, and then repeatedly saves the `Tower` instance to disk using the `save` method. The `Bencher` struct provided by the `test` crate is used to measure the execution time of the `save` method.

The second benchmark test, `bench_generate_ancestors_descendants`, measures the time it takes to generate the ancestors and descendants of a set of banks using the `VoteSimulator` struct. The test initializes a `Tower` instance, a `BankForks` instance, and a `VoteSimulator` instance, and then creates a new branch in the `VoteSimulator` instance with a specified number of banks. The `ancestors` and `descendants` methods of the `BankForks` instance are then repeatedly called in a loop to generate the ancestors and descendants of the banks. The `Bencher` struct is used to measure the execution time of the loop.

These benchmark tests are useful for measuring the performance of the `Tower` struct and its associated components, and can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the consensus algorithm. The `Tower` struct is a critical component of the Solana blockchain, and its performance is essential for maintaining the security and scalability of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `bench_save_tower` function?
   - The `bench_save_tower` function benchmarks the time it takes to save a Tower object to a FileTowerStorage using a given node keypair and vote account pubkey.
2. What is the purpose of the `bench_generate_ancestors_descendants` function?
   - The `bench_generate_ancestors_descendants` function benchmarks the time it takes to generate ancestors and descendants for a set of banks using a VoteSimulator object and a Tower object.
3. What is the role of the `tower_storage` variable in the `bench_save_tower` function?
   - The `tower_storage` variable is an instance of the `FileTowerStorage` struct that is used to store the Tower object in a temporary directory.
