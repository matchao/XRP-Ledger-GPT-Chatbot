The `log_collector.rs` file contains the implementation of a `LogCollector` struct that is used to collect log messages. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to collect log messages and limit the size of the log messages that can be collected. The `LogCollector` struct has a `messages` field that is a vector of strings that stores the log messages that have been collected. The `bytes_written` field is used to keep track of the number of bytes that have been written to the log messages. The `bytes_limit` field is an optional field that is used to limit the number of bytes that can be written to the log messages. The `limit_warning` field is a boolean field that is used to indicate whether the log messages have been truncated due to the size limit.

The `LogCollector` struct has several methods that can be used to interact with the log messages. The `log` method is used to add a log message to the `messages` vector. If the `bytes_limit` field is set, the method checks whether the log message will exceed the limit. If the limit is exceeded, the method adds a "Log truncated" message to the `messages` vector and sets the `limit_warning` field to true. The `get_recorded_content` method returns a slice of the `messages` vector. The `new_ref` method returns a new reference-counted `LogCollector` instance with default values. The `new_ref_with_limit` method returns a new reference-counted `LogCollector` instance with a specified size limit.

The file also contains two convenience macros, `ic_logger_msg` and `ic_msg`, that are used to log messages with an `Option<Rc<RefCell<LogCollector>>>` and an `InvokeContext`, respectively.

The `tests` module contains a test for the `test_log_messages_bytes_limit` function that tests whether the log messages are truncated when the size limit is exceeded.

Overall, the `LogCollector` struct provides a way to collect log messages and limit the size of the log messages that can be collected. This is useful for managing the size of log files and preventing them from growing too large. The convenience macros make it easy to log messages with the `LogCollector` struct.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LogCollector` struct?
- The `LogCollector` struct is used to collect log messages and limit the number of bytes written to the log.

2. What is the purpose of the `ic_logger_msg!` macro?
- The `ic_logger_msg!` macro is a convenience macro used to log a message with an `Option<Rc<RefCell<LogCollector>>>`.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_log_messages_bytes_limit` function in the `tests` module?
- The `test_log_messages_bytes_limit` function tests that the `LogCollector` struct correctly limits the number of log messages based on the byte limit and truncates the log messages when the limit is reached.
