The `poh_config.rs` file contains the definition of Solana's proof of history. Proof of history is a mechanism used to generate a verifiable, time-ordered sequence of events in a decentralized network. The `PohConfig` struct defines the configuration parameters for proof of history.

The `PohConfig` struct has three fields:
- `target_tick_duration`: The target duration between ticks in the cluster.
- `target_tick_count`: The target total tick count to be produced; used for testing only.
- `hashes_per_tick`: The number of hashes to roll before emitting the next tick entry. If this field is set to `None`, "Low power mode" is enabled, which implies sleeping for `target_tick_duration` instead of hashing, and the number of hashes per tick will be variable.

The `PohConfig` struct implements two methods:
- `new_sleep`: This method creates a new `PohConfig` instance with the `hashes_per_tick` and `target_tick_count` fields set to `None`, and the `target_tick_duration` field set to the specified duration.
- `default`: This method creates a new `PohConfig` instance with the `hashes_per_tick` and `target_tick_count` fields set to `None`, and the `target_tick_duration` field set to the default tick duration. The default tick duration is calculated as the result of dividing one second by the default number of ticks per second.

This code is used in the larger Solana project to configure the proof of history mechanism. The `PohConfig` struct is used in various parts of the codebase to specify the desired tick rate and other parameters for proof of history. For example, the `PohService` struct, which is responsible for generating proof of history entries, takes a `PohConfig` instance as a parameter. 

Here is an example of how to create a new `PohConfig` instance with a target tick duration of 500 milliseconds:
```
use solana_sdk::poh_config::PohConfig;
use std::time::Duration;

let config = PohConfig::new_sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the PohConfig struct?
    - The PohConfig struct defines the configuration parameters for Solana's proof of history, including the target tick rate, target tick count, and hashes per tick.

2. What is the difference between "Low power mode" and regular mode?
    - "Low power mode" is enabled when hashes_per_tick is set to None, which causes the system to sleep for the target tick duration instead of hashing and results in a variable number of hashes per tick. Regular mode hashes a fixed number of hashes per tick.

3. What is the purpose of the unchecked_div_by_const macro in the Default implementation?
    - The unchecked_div_by_const macro is used to calculate the target tick duration in microseconds based on the default ticks per second value. It is used to avoid a runtime division operation and instead performs a compile-time division.
