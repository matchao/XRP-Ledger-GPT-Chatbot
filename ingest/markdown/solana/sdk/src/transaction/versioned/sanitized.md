The `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` struct is defined in this file, which wraps a sanitized `VersionedTransaction` to provide a safe API. It contains two fields: `signatures`, which is a list of signatures, and `message`, which is the message to sign. 

The `TryFrom` trait is implemented for `VersionedTransaction` to convert it to a `SanitizedVersionedTransaction`. The `try_new` method is also implemented for `SanitizedVersionedTransaction`, which takes a `VersionedTransaction` as input and returns a `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` if the transaction is valid. If the transaction is invalid, it returns a `SanitizeError`. 

The `get_message` method is also implemented for `SanitizedVersionedTransaction`, which returns a reference to the `SanitizedVersionedMessage` contained in the transaction.

The `tests` module contains two unit tests. The first test checks if `try_new` returns an error when the `signatures` field is empty. The second test checks if `try_new` returns an error when the `num_readonly_signed_accounts` field in the `message` header is greater than the number of signatures in the `signatures` field.

This code is used in the Solana SDK to provide a safe API for working with versioned transactions. It ensures that transactions are properly sanitized before they are used, which helps prevent errors and vulnerabilities in the system. Developers can use this code to create and validate transactions in their Solana applications. For example, they can create a new `VersionedTransaction`, convert it to a `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` using the `TryFrom` trait, and then use the `get_message` method to retrieve the sanitized message for signing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` struct?
- The `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` struct wraps a sanitized `VersionedTransaction` to provide a safe API.
2. What is the `TryFrom` trait used for in this code?
- The `TryFrom` trait is used to implement a conversion from `VersionedTransaction` to `SanitizedVersionedTransaction`, returning a `SanitizeError` if the conversion fails.
3. What is the purpose of the `test_try_new_with_invalid_signatures` and `test_try_new` tests?
- The `test_try_new_with_invalid_signatures` and `test_try_new` tests are used to test the `try_new` method of the `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` struct, checking for errors when creating a new `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` from a `VersionedTransaction` with invalid signatures or an invalid message.
