The `deserialize_utils.rs` file contains helper functions for deserializing versioned structs using the `serde` library. The `default_on_eof` function is used to deserialize structs that may have additional fields added to the end of the struct, as long as those fields implement the `Default` trait. This function is currently targeted at `bincode` deserialization, but the error match may need to be updated if another package is used in the future. 

The `ignore_eof_error` function is used to ignore errors that occur when deserializing a struct. If the error message is "io error: unexpected end of file" or "io error: failed to fill whole buffer", the function returns the default value of the struct. Otherwise, it returns the result of the deserialization. 

The `tests` module contains tests for the `default_on_eof` function. The tests use a struct called `Foo` that has a `bar` field of type `u16`, an optional `baz` field of type `u16`, and a `quz` field of type `String`. The `baz` and `quz` fields are tagged with `deserialize_with = "default_on_eof"`. The tests ensure that the `default_on_eof` function correctly deserializes `Foo` structs with different combinations of data in the input vector. 

The `test_default_on_eof_additional_untagged_fields` test ensures that deserialization will panic if later fields are not tagged with `deserialize_with = "default_on_eof"`. If a field is missing, even if another field is tagged, deserialization will panic. 

Overall, this file provides helper functions for deserializing versioned structs with additional fields. The `default_on_eof` function allows for successful deserialization of structs with additional fields that implement the `Default` trait, and the `ignore_eof_error` function handles errors that may occur during deserialization. The tests ensure that the functions work as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `default_on_eof` function?
- The `default_on_eof` function enables successful deserialization of versioned structs by allowing new structs to include additional fields if they impl Default and are added to the end of the struct.

2. What is the purpose of the `ignore_eof_error` function?
- The `ignore_eof_error` function is used to ignore specific errors that may occur during deserialization, such as "io error: unexpected end of file" or "io error: failed to fill whole buffer".

3. What is the purpose of the `test_default_on_eof_additional_untagged_fields` test?
- The `test_default_on_eof_additional_untagged_fields` test is used to ensure that deserialization will panic on any missing fields/data if later fields are not tagged `deserialize_with = "default_on_eof"`.
