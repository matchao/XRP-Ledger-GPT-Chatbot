The `presigner.rs` file contains the implementation of a `Presigner` struct, which is a `Signer` implementation that represents a `Signature` that has been constructed externally. The purpose of this struct is to perform a signature verification against the expected message upon `sign()` requests to affirm its relationship to the `message` bytes.

The `Presigner` struct has two fields: `pubkey` and `signature`. The `new()` method is used to create a new `Presigner` instance with the given `pubkey` and `signature`. The `try_pubkey()` method returns the `pubkey` of the `Presigner`, while the `try_sign_message()` method verifies the signature against the expected message and returns the `signature` if the verification is successful. If the verification fails, it returns a `PresignerError::VerificationFailure` error.

The `Presigner` struct implements the `Signer` trait, which defines the methods that a signer must implement. The `is_interactive()` method always returns `false`, indicating that the `Presigner` is not interactive. The `eq()` method is also implemented to compare the `pubkey` of the `Presigner` with another `Signer`.

The `tests` module contains a unit test for the `Presigner` struct. It creates a `keypair` from a seed, generates a `pubkey` from the `keypair`, signs a message with the `keypair`, and creates a `Presigner` instance with the `pubkey` and `signature`. It then tests the `try_pubkey()`, `pubkey()`, `try_sign_message()`, `sign_message()`, and `eq()` methods of the `Presigner` struct.

Overall, the `Presigner` struct is used to represent a pre-generated signature that can be used to verify the authenticity of a message. It can be used in the larger Solana project to sign and verify transactions, messages, and other data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Presigner` struct?
    
    The `Presigner` struct is a `Signer` implementation that represents a `Signature` that has been constructed externally and performs a signature verification against the expected message upon `sign()` requests to affirm its relationship to the `message` bytes.

2. What is the `PresignerError` enum used for?
    
    The `PresignerError` enum is used to represent errors that can occur when using the `Presigner` struct, specifically when the pre-generated signature cannot verify data.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_presigner` function in the `tests` module?
    
    The `test_presigner` function tests the functionality of the `Presigner` struct by creating a `Presigner` instance, asserting that its methods return the expected values, and testing its equality with a `Keypair` instance.
