The `inflation.rs` file contains the implementation of the `Inflation` struct, which represents the configuration for network inflation. The struct has several fields that define the inflation rate over time, the allocation of inflation to the foundation, and the duration of the foundation pool inflation. The struct also has several methods that allow for the calculation of the inflation rate at a given year, the portion of the total inflation that goes to validators, and the portion that goes to the foundation.

The `Inflation` struct has a `Default` implementation that sets the default values for the inflation configuration. The default values are defined as constants at the top of the file. The `Inflation` struct also has several constructor methods that allow for the creation of an inflation configuration with specific values. For example, the `new_fixed` method creates an inflation configuration with a fixed inflation rate at a given percentage for staking rewards, and none for the foundation.

The `Inflation` struct has three methods that allow for the calculation of the inflation rate at a given year, the portion of the total inflation that goes to validators, and the portion that goes to the foundation. The `total` method calculates the inflation rate at a given year based on the initial inflation percentage, the terminal inflation percentage, and the rate per year at which inflation is lowered until reaching the terminal. The `validator` method calculates the portion of the total inflation that goes to validators based on the inflation rate at a given year and the portion of total inflation allocated to the foundation. The `foundation` method calculates the portion of the total inflation that goes to the foundation based on the inflation rate at a given year and the duration of the foundation pool inflation.

The `tests` module contains two test functions that test the basic functionality of the `Inflation` struct. The `test_inflation_basic` function tests the inflation rate calculation for different years, while the `test_inflation_fixed` function tests the inflation rate calculation for a fixed inflation rate.

Overall, the `Inflation` struct provides a way to configure the inflation rate for the Solana network and calculate the portion of the total inflation that goes to validators and the foundation. This is an important aspect of the Solana network's economic model and is used in conjunction with other economic mechanisms to incentivize network participation and growth.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Inflation` struct and its fields?
- The `Inflation` struct is used to configure network inflation, and its fields represent various inflation parameters such as initial and terminal inflation percentages, taper rate, and foundation allocation.

2. What are the default values for the inflation parameters?
- The default values for the inflation parameters are defined as constants at the top of the file, and are as follows: `DEFAULT_INITIAL` = 0.08, `DEFAULT_TERMINAL` = 0.015, `DEFAULT_TAPER` = 0.15, `DEFAULT_FOUNDATION` = 0.05, and `DEFAULT_FOUNDATION_TERM` = 7.0.

3. What are the `total`, `validator`, and `foundation` methods used for?
- The `total` method calculates the total inflation rate at a given year based on the inflation parameters, while the `validator` and `foundation` methods calculate the portion of the total inflation that goes to validators and the foundation, respectively. These methods are used in tests to verify that the inflation calculations are correct.
