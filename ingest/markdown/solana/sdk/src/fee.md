The `fee.rs` file contains the implementation of fee structures used in the Solana blockchain. The purpose of this code is to define the fees associated with transactions on the Solana blockchain. The fees are calculated based on the number of signatures and write locks required for a transaction, as well as the compute units used.

The `FeeBin` struct defines a fee and its associated compute unit limit. The `FeeStructure` struct contains information used to calculate fees, including the lamports per signature, lamports per write lock, and compute unit fee bins. The `new` function initializes a new `FeeStructure` instance with the given parameters. The `get_max_fee` function calculates the maximum fee for a transaction based on the number of signatures and write locks required, as well as the compute units used.

For example, to create a new `FeeStructure` instance with a lamports per signature of 100, a lamports per write lock of 50, and a compute fee bin with a limit of 1000 and a fee of 0.01 SOL, the following code can be used:

```
let fee_structure = FeeStructure::new(0.01, 0.00000005, vec![(1000, 0.01)]);
```

To calculate the maximum fee for a transaction with 2 signatures and 1 write lock, the following code can be used:

```
let max_fee = fee_structure.get_max_fee(2, 1);
```

The `Default` implementation for `FeeStructure` initializes a new instance with default values of 0.000005 SOL per signature, 0.0 SOL per write lock, and a compute fee bin with a limit of 1,400,000 and a fee of 0.0 SOL.

Overall, the `fee.rs` file provides a way to define and calculate fees for transactions on the Solana blockchain. This is an important aspect of the blockchain's functionality, as it ensures that transactions are processed efficiently and that users are incentivized to use the network in a way that benefits the network as a whole.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FeeStructure` struct and its associated methods?
- The `FeeStructure` struct is used to calculate fees and contains information such as the lamports per signature and write lock, as well as compute unit fee bins. The `get_max_fee` method calculates the maximum fee based on the number of signatures and write locks, as well as the compute unit fee bins.

2. What is the purpose of the `FeeBin` struct and its associated fields?
- The `FeeBin` struct represents a fee and its associated compute unit limit. The `limit` field specifies the maximum number of compute units for which the fee will be charged, while the `fee` field specifies the fee in lamports.

3. What is the purpose of the `sol_to_lamports` function?
- The `sol_to_lamports` function is used to convert a floating-point value of SOL (the native token of the Solana blockchain) to lamports (the smallest unit of currency in Solana). It is used in the `new` method of the `FeeStructure` struct to convert the SOL values to lamports.
