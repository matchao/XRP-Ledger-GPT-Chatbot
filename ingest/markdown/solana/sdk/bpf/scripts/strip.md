The `strip.sh` script is a Bash script that is used to strip debug symbols from a shared object file. The purpose of this script is to reduce the size of the shared object file and remove any unnecessary information that is not needed for execution. This script is part of the Solana project and is located in the `solana/sdk/bpf/scripts` directory.

The script takes two arguments: the path to the unstripped shared object file and the path to the stripped shared object file. If the unstripped file is not readable, the script will exit with an error message. If the stripped file path is not provided, the script will print a usage message and exit.

The script then sets the `bpf_sdk` variable to the path of the Solana BPF SDK directory. It sources the `env.sh` file located in the SDK directory to set environment variables needed for the script to run.

The `set -e` command sets the script to exit immediately if any command fails. The `out_dir` variable is set to the directory of the stripped shared object file. If the directory does not exist, the script creates it using the `mkdir -p` command.

Finally, the script uses the `llvm-objcopy` command from the BPF SDK's `bpf-tools` directory to strip all debug symbols from the unstripped shared object file and save the result to the stripped shared object file.

Example usage:

```
./strip.sh mylib_unstripped.so mylib.so
```

This will strip the debug symbols from `mylib_unstripped.so` and save the result to `mylib.so`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to strip debug symbols from a given shared object file.

2. What are the input parameters for this script?
   
   The script takes two input parameters: the path to the unstripped shared object file and the path to the stripped shared object file.

3. What external dependencies does this script have?
   
   This script depends on the LLVM-based bpf-tools package, specifically the llvm-objcopy binary, which is used to perform the actual stripping of debug symbols.
