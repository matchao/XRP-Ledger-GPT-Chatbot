# Solana Cross-Program Invocation

The `cpi.inc` file contains the implementation of the Solana Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) API. The CPI API allows one Solana program to invoke another Solana program. This is useful when a program needs to perform an operation that requires the functionality of another program. 

The file defines several constants and data structures that are used by the CPI API. The `MAX_CPI_INSTRUCTION_DATA_LEN` constant defines the maximum size of the data that can be passed to a CPI instruction. The `MAX_CPI_INSTRUCTION_ACCOUNTS` constant defines the maximum number of accounts that can be passed to a CPI instruction. The `MAX_CPI_ACCOUNT_INFOS` constant defines the maximum number of account info structs that can be used in a single CPI invocation.

The `SolAccountMeta` struct defines the metadata for an account that is passed to a CPI instruction. It contains the account's public key, whether the account is writable, and whether the account is a signer. The `SolInstruction` struct defines the instruction that is passed to a CPI invocation. It contains the program ID of the instruction processor that executes the instruction, the metadata for the accounts that should be passed to the instruction processor, and the opaque data that is passed to the instruction processor.

The file also defines two functions for invoking a CPI instruction. The `sol_invoke_signed` function invokes a CPI instruction and signs for some of the keys. The `sol_invoke` function invokes a CPI instruction without signing any keys. Both functions take an instruction, an array of account infos, and the length of the account infos array as arguments. The `sol_invoke_signed` function also takes an array of signer seeds and the length of the signer seeds array as arguments.

Overall, the `cpi.inc` file provides the implementation of the CPI API, which allows Solana programs to invoke other Solana programs. This is an important feature that enables Solana programs to work together and perform complex operations. 

Example usage:

```c
SolAccountMeta account_metas[] = {
  {&account1_pubkey, true, false},
  {&account2_pubkey, false, true},
  {&account3_pubkey, true, false},
};

SolInstruction instruction = {
  &program_id,
  account_metas,
  3,
  data,
  data_len
};

SolAccountInfo account_infos[] = {
  {&account1_pubkey, account1_data, account1_data_len},
  {&account2_pubkey, account2_data, account2_data_len},
  {&account3_pubkey, account3_data, account3_data_len},
};

uint64_t result = sol_invoke(&instruction, account_infos, 3);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines structures and constants for cross-program invocation (CPI) in Solana, as well as functions for invoking other programs with or without signing for some of the keys.

2. What is the maximum size of CPI instruction data and why was this size chosen?
    
    The maximum size of CPI instruction data is 10 KiB, which was chosen to ensure that CPI instructions are not more limited than transaction instructions if the size of transactions is doubled in the future.

3. What is the maximum number of account info structs that can be used in a single CPI invocation and why was this number chosen?
    
    The maximum number of account info structs that can be used in a single CPI invocation is 128, which was chosen to match the max number of locked accounts per transaction (MAX_TX_ACCOUNT_LOCKS).
