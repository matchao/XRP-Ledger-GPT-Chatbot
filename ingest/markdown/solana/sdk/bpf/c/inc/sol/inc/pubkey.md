# Solana Public Key

The `pubkey.inc` file contains the implementation of the Solana Public Key. It defines the `SolPubkey` struct, which is a 32-byte array representing a public key. It also defines the `SIZE_PUBKEY` constant, which is the size of the public key in bytes.

The file provides two functions to work with public keys. The first function is `sol_log_pubkey`, which prints the hexadecimal representation of a public key. The second function is `SolPubkey_same`, which compares two public keys and returns `true` if they are the same.

The file also defines two structs, `SolSignerSeed` and `SolSignerSeeds`, which are used to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`. The `SolSignerSeed` struct contains a pointer to an array of seed bytes and the length of the seed bytes. The `SolSignerSeeds` struct contains an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs and the number of seeds.

The file provides two functions to work with program addresses. The first function is `sol_create_program_address`, which creates a program address using the provided seeds and program id of the signer. The function returns a `uint64_t` value, which is the status of the operation. The created program address is filled in the `program_address` parameter. The second function is `sol_try_find_program_address`, which tries to find a program address using the provided seeds and program id of the signer. The function returns a `uint64_t` value, which is the status of the operation. The created program address is filled in the `program_address` parameter, and the bump seed required to create a valid program address is filled in the `bump_seed` parameter.

The file also provides a stub function `sol_log_pubkey` when building tests. This function prints the hexadecimal representation of a public key to the console.

Overall, the `pubkey.inc` file provides the necessary functions to work with public keys and program addresses in the Solana project. Developers can use these functions to create and compare public keys, as well as create program addresses using seeds and program ids of signers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SolPubkey` struct and how is it used?
    
    The `SolPubkey` struct represents a public key and is used to store a 32-byte array of bytes. It can be used to print the hexadecimal representation of a public key and to compare two public keys for equality.

2. What is the `SolSignerSeed` struct and how is it used?
    
    The `SolSignerSeed` struct represents a seed used to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`. It contains a pointer to an array of seed bytes and the length of the seed bytes.

3. What is the purpose of the `sol_create_program_address` function and how is it used?
    
    The `sol_create_program_address` function is used to create a program address from a set of seeds and a program id. It takes an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs, the length of the array, a `SolPubkey` representing the program id, and a pointer to a `SolPubkey` that will be filled with the resulting program address. It returns a 64-bit integer that can be used to check if the program address was successfully created.
