# Solana Public Key

The `pubkey.h` file defines the Solana Public Key structure and provides functions to create, compare, and print public keys. The Solana Public Key is a 32-byte array that represents a public key on the Solana blockchain. 

The `SolPubkey` structure is defined as follows:

```c
typedef struct {
  uint8_t x[SIZE_PUBKEY];
} SolPubkey;
```

The `SIZE_PUBKEY` constant is defined as 32, which is the size of the public key in bytes. 

The `SolPubkey_same` function is used to compare two public keys. It takes two `SolPubkey` pointers as input and returns `true` if the two public keys are the same. 

The `sol_create_program_address` function is used to create a program address. It takes an array of `SolSignerSeed` structures, the length of the array, the program ID of the signer, and a pointer to a `SolPubkey` structure as input. It returns a `uint64_t` value that indicates whether the program address was successfully created. 

The `sol_try_find_program_address` function is used to try to find a program address and return the corresponding bump seed. It takes an array of `SolSignerSeed` structures, the length of the array, the program ID of the signer, a pointer to a `SolPubkey` structure, and a pointer to a `uint8_t` value as input. It returns a `uint64_t` value that indicates whether the program address was successfully found. 

The `sol_log_pubkey` function is used to print the hexadecimal representation of a public key. It takes a `SolPubkey` pointer as input and prints the hexadecimal representation of the public key to the console. 

Overall, the `pubkey.h` file provides essential functionality for working with public keys on the Solana blockchain. It is used throughout the Solana project to create and compare program addresses, sign transactions, and verify signatures. 

Example usage:

```c
#include <sol/pubkey.h>

int main() {
  SolPubkey pubkey1, pubkey2;
  // initialize pubkey1 and pubkey2
  bool same = SolPubkey_same(&pubkey1, &pubkey2);
  if (same) {
    printf("Public keys are the same\n");
  } else {
    printf("Public keys are different\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SolPubkey` struct and how is it used?
   
   The `SolPubkey` struct represents a public key in Solana and is used to store a 32-byte array of bytes. It is used in various functions throughout the Solana SDK to represent public keys.

2. What is the purpose of the `sol_create_program_address` function and how is it used?
   
   The `sol_create_program_address` function is used to create a program address from a set of seeds and a program ID. It takes in an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs, the length of the array, a `SolPubkey` representing the program ID, and a pointer to a `SolPubkey` that will be filled with the resulting program address. The function returns a `uint64_t` error code.

3. What is the purpose of the `sol_try_find_program_address` function and how is it used?
   
   The `sol_try_find_program_address` function is used to find a program address and return the corresponding bump seed. It takes in an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs, the length of the array, a `SolPubkey` representing the program ID, a pointer to a `SolPubkey` that will be filled with the resulting program address, and a pointer to a `uint8_t` that will be filled with the bump seed. The function returns a `uint64_t` error code.
