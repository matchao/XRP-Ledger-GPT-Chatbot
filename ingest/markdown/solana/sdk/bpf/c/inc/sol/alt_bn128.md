# Solana Alt_bn128 Elliptic Curve Operations

The `alt_bn128.h` file in the Solana project contains code for performing elliptic curve operations on the alt_bn128 curve. The file provides functions for addition, multiplication, and pairing on the curve.

The `sol_alt_bn128` function performs addition on the alt_bn128 curve. It takes in a group operation, input, input size, and a 64-byte array to hold the result. The function returns 0 if executed successfully. 

```c
uint64_t sol_alt_bn128(
        const uint64_t *group_op,
        const uint8_t *input,
        const uint64_t input_size,
        uint8_t *result
);
```

The `sol_alt_bn128_pointer_type` and `sol_alt_bn128` functions are used when the `SOL_SBFV2` flag is defined. The `sol_alt_bn128_pointer_type` is a typedef for a function pointer that takes in the same parameters as the `sol_alt_bn128` function. The `sol_alt_bn128` function is a static function that calls the function pointer with the given arguments.

```c
typedef uint64_t(*sol_alt_bn128_pointer_type)(
        const uint64_t *group_op,
        const uint8_t *input,
        const uint64_t input_size,
        uint8_t *result
);

static uint64_t sol_alt_bn128(
        const uint64_t *group_op arg1,
        const uint8_t *input arg2,
        const uint64_t input_size arg3,
        uint8_t *result arg4
) {
  sol_alt_bn128_pointer_type sol_alt_bn128_pointer = (sol_alt_bn128_pointer_type) 2551807235;
  return sol_alt_bn128_pointer(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4);
}
```

Overall, this file provides necessary functionality for performing elliptic curve operations on the alt_bn128 curve in the Solana project. It can be used in conjunction with other files in the project to build more complex applications that require elliptic curve cryptography.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides functions for elliptic curve addition, multiplication, and pairing for the Solana bn128 elliptic curve.

2. What is the input and output format for the `sol_alt_bn128` function?
    
    The `sol_alt_bn128` function takes in a group operation, input byte array, input size, and a 64 byte array to hold the result. It returns 0 if executed successfully.

3. Why is there a `#ifndef SOL_SBFV2` statement in the code?
    
    The `#ifndef SOL_SBFV2` statement is used to conditionally compile the `sol_alt_bn128` function based on whether or not `SOL_SBFV2` is defined. If it is defined, a function pointer is created instead of the function itself.
