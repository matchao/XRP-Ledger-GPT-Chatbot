The `sbf.mk` makefile is responsible for building Solana Blockchain Framework (SBF) programs from C or C++ source files into Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binaries. It also provides support for building and running tests for these programs. The makefile assumes that programs are located in the `$(SRC_DIR)/<program name>` directory and tests are located in their corresponding program directory with names starting with `test_`. The output files will be placed in the `$(OUT_DIR)` directory.

The makefile provides several user settings that can be overridden on the command line, such as include directories, source directories, output directories, and the location of LLVM. It also sets up various flags for the C and C++ compilers, linker, and other tools like `llvm-objdump` and `llvm-readelf`.

The makefile defines several rules for building programs and tests, such as compiling C and C++ source files, generating dependency files, linking object files into shared libraries, and running tests. It also provides rules for dumping the contents of a program to stdout and displaying information about the ELF binary using `llvm-objdump` and `llvm-readelf`, respectively.

Example usage of the makefile:

- `make all`: Build all programs and tests, and run the tests.
- `make programs`: Build all programs.
- `make tests`: Build and run all tests.
- `make dump_<program name>`: Dump the contents of the program to stdout.
- `make readelf_<program name>`: Display information about the ELF binary.
- `make <program name>`: Build a single program by name.
- `make <test name>`: Build and run a single test by name.

For example, assuming a program named `foo` located in `src/foo/foo.c`, you can build the program using `make foo`, and dump its contents using `make dump_foo`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SOL_SBFV2` variable and how does it affect the build process?
   **Answer:** The `SOL_SBFV2` variable is used to enable or disable certain build options related to the Solana SBFv2 (Solana Binary Format version 2). When `SOL_SBFV2` is set to 1, additional flags are added to the `C_FLAGS` and `SBF_LLD_FLAGS` to enable features specific to SBFv2.

2. **Question:** How are the test executables built and executed using this makefile?
   **Answer:** Test executables are built using the `TEST_C_RULE` and `TEST_CC_RULE` for C and C++ source files, respectively. These rules include the necessary flags for linking the Criterion test framework. The tests are executed using the `TEST_EXEC_RULE`, which sets the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the Criterion library and runs the test executable.

3. **Question:** How does the makefile handle dependencies and ensure that only the necessary files are rebuilt when a source file is modified?
   **Answer:** The makefile uses dependency files (with the `.d` extension) to track the dependencies of each object file. These dependency files are generated using the `D_RULE`, `DXX_RULE`, `TEST_D_RULE`, and `TEST_DXX_RULE` for C and C++ source files. The `-include` directive is used to include the dependency files, ensuring that only the necessary files are rebuilt when a source file is modified.
