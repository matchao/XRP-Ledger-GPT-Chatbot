# Solana Public Key

The `pubkey.h` file contains the implementation of the Solana Public Key. It defines the `SolPubkey` struct, which is a 32-byte array representing the public key. It also defines the `SIZE_PUBKEY` constant, which is the size of the public key in bytes.

The file provides two functions to create and compare public keys. The `SolPubkey_same` function compares two public keys and returns `true` if they are the same. The `sol_create_program_address` function creates a program address using the provided seeds and program ID. It returns a `SolPubkey` struct representing the program address. The `sol_try_find_program_address` function tries to find a program address and returns the corresponding bump seed.

The file also provides a `SolSignerSeed` struct representing the seed used to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`. It contains a pointer to the seed bytes and the length of the seed bytes. The `SolSignerSeeds` struct represents the seeds used by a signer to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`. It contains an array of signer's seeds and the number of seeds.

The `sol_log_pubkey` function prints the hexadecimal representation of a public key. It is used for debugging purposes.

Overall, the `pubkey.h` file provides the necessary functionality to create, compare, and log Solana public keys. It is an essential part of the Solana SDK and is used extensively in the larger project.

Example usage:

```c
#include <sol/pubkey.h>

int main() {
  SolPubkey pubkey1, pubkey2;
  // Initialize pubkey1 and pubkey2
  bool same = SolPubkey_same(&pubkey1, &pubkey2);
  if (same) {
    printf("Public keys are the same\n");
  } else {
    printf("Public keys are different\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SolPubkey` struct and how is it used?
   - The `SolPubkey` struct represents a public key in Solana and is used to store a 32-byte array of bytes. It is used in various functions throughout the codebase to represent public keys.
2. What is the purpose of the `sol_create_program_address` function and how is it used?
   - The `sol_create_program_address` function is used to create a program address from a set of seeds and a program id. It takes in an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs, the length of the array, a `SolPubkey` representing the program id, and a pointer to a `SolPubkey` that will be filled with the resulting program address. It returns a `uint64_t` error code.
3. What is the purpose of the `SolSignerSeeds` struct and how is it used?
   - The `SolSignerSeeds` struct represents an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs and is used to pass multiple seeds to functions that require them. It contains a pointer to the array of seeds and the length of the array.
