# Solana Public Key

The `pubkey.inc` file contains the implementation of the Solana Public Key. It defines the `SolPubkey` struct, which is a 32-byte array representing a public key. It also defines the `SIZE_PUBKEY` constant, which is the size of the public key in bytes.

The file provides two functions to work with public keys. The first function is `sol_log_pubkey`, which prints the hexadecimal representation of a public key. The second function is `SolPubkey_same`, which compares two public keys and returns true if they are the same.

The file also defines two structs, `SolSignerSeed` and `SolSignerSeeds`, which are used to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`. The `SolSignerSeed` struct contains a pointer to the seed bytes and the length of the seed bytes. The `SolSignerSeeds` struct contains an array of `SolSignerSeed` structs and the number of seeds.

The file provides two functions to work with program addresses. The first function is `sol_create_program_address`, which creates a program address using the seed bytes, the program id of the signer, and fills the `program_address` parameter on return. The second function is `sol_try_find_program_address`, which tries to find a program address and returns the corresponding bump seed.

In addition, the file provides a stub function `sol_log_pubkey` for testing purposes. This function prints the hexadecimal representation of a public key to the console.

Overall, the `pubkey.inc` file is an essential part of the Solana project, as it provides the implementation of the Solana Public Key and functions to work with program addresses. Developers can use these functions to create and compare public keys and program addresses, which are essential for building decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain. 

Example usage:

```c
#include <sol/pubkey.h>

// create a new public key
SolPubkey pubkey;

// print the hexadecimal representation of the public key
sol_log_pubkey(&pubkey);

// compare two public keys
SolPubkey pubkey1, pubkey2;
bool same = SolPubkey_same(&pubkey1, &pubkey2);

// create a program address
SolSignerSeed seed = {seed_bytes, seed_len};
SolPubkey program_id, program_address;
uint64_t result = sol_create_program_address(&seed, 1, &program_id, &program_address);

// try to find a program address
uint8_t bump_seed;
result = sol_try_find_program_address(&seed, 1, &program_id, &program_address, &bump_seed);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SolPubkey_same` function?
    
    `SolPubkey_same` is a function that compares two public keys and returns true if they are the same.

2. What is the difference between `SolSignerSeed` and `SolSignerSeeds`?
    
    `SolSignerSeed` is a struct that contains a single seed used to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`, while `SolSignerSeeds` is a struct that contains an array of seeds used by a signer to create a program address or passed to `sol_invoke_signed`.

3. What is the purpose of the `sol_try_find_program_address` function?
    
    `sol_try_find_program_address` is a function that tries to find a program address and returns the corresponding bump seed. It takes in seed bytes used to sign program accounts, program id of the signer, and a program address created, filled on return.
