# Solana Alt_bn128 Elliptic Curve Operations

The `alt_bn128.h` file is a header file that provides functions for performing elliptic curve operations on the alt_bn128 curve. The file contains a function for performing addition on elliptic curves, which takes in a group operation, input, input size, and a 64-byte array to hold the result. 

The purpose of this file is to provide a set of functions that can be used to perform cryptographic operations on the alt_bn128 curve. These operations are used in various parts of the Solana project, such as in the implementation of the Solana blockchain's consensus algorithm.

The `sol_alt_bn128` function is used to perform addition on elliptic curves. It takes in a group operation, input, input size, and a 64-byte array to hold the result. The function returns 0 if executed successfully. 

Here is an example of how the `sol_alt_bn128` function can be used:

```c
#include <sol/alt_bn128.h>

int main() {
    uint64_t group_op[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    uint8_t input[32] = {0};
    uint8_t result[64] = {0};

    uint64_t ret = sol_alt_bn128(group_op, input, 32, result);
    if (ret != 0) {
        // handle error
    }

    // use result
    return 0;
}
```

In conclusion, the `alt_bn128.h` file provides functions for performing elliptic curve operations on the alt_bn128 curve. These functions are used in various parts of the Solana project, such as in the implementation of the Solana blockchain's consensus algorithm. The `sol_alt_bn128` function is used to perform addition on elliptic curves and takes in a group operation, input, input size, and a 64-byte array to hold the result.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides functions for elliptic curve addition, multiplication, and pairing for the Solana bn128 elliptic curve.

2. What is the input and output format for the `sol_alt_bn128` function?
    
    The `sol_alt_bn128` function takes in a group operation, input byte array, input size, and a 64 byte array to hold the result. It returns 0 if executed successfully.

3. Why is there a `#ifndef SOL_SBFV2` statement in the code?
    
    The `#ifndef SOL_SBFV2` statement is used to conditionally compile the `sol_alt_bn128` function based on whether or not the `SOL_SBFV2` macro is defined. If it is defined, a function pointer is created instead of the function itself.
