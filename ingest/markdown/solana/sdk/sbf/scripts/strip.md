The `strip.sh` script is a bash script that takes in two arguments: an unstripped shared object file (`$so`) and a stripped shared object file (`$so_stripped`). The purpose of this script is to strip all symbols from the unstripped shared object file and output the result to the stripped shared object file.

The script first checks if the unstripped shared object file exists and is readable. If it is not, the script outputs an error message and exits with a status code of 1. If the unstripped shared object file exists and is readable, the script proceeds to check if the stripped shared object file argument is empty. If it is empty, the script outputs a usage message and exits with a status code of 1.

The script then sets the `sbf_sdk` variable to the parent directory of the directory containing the `strip.sh` script. It does this by using the `cd` command to change the current directory to the parent directory of the directory containing the `strip.sh` script, and then using the `pwd` command to get the absolute path of the current directory. This is done so that the script can reference other files and directories in the Solana SDK.

The script then sources the `env.sh` file located in the Solana SDK directory using the `source` command. This file sets environment variables and exports them so that they can be used by other scripts in the Solana SDK.

The script then sets the `-e` option, which causes the script to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status. This is done to ensure that the script stops executing if any errors occur.

The script then sets the `out_dir` variable to the directory containing the stripped shared object file. If this directory does not exist, the script creates it using the `mkdir -p` command.

Finally, the script uses the `llvm-objcopy` command located in the Solana SDK's `sbf-tools` directory to strip all symbols from the unstripped shared object file and output the result to the stripped shared object file. The `--strip-all` option is used to strip all symbols from the shared object file.

This script is used in the Solana SDK to strip symbols from shared object files. This is useful for reducing the size of the shared object files and for preventing symbol collisions when linking multiple shared object files together. An example usage of this script would be to strip symbols from a shared object file named `libexample.so` and output the result to a stripped shared object file named `libexample_stripped.so`:

```
./strip.sh libexample.so libexample_stripped.so
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script is used to strip symbols from a shared object file.

2. What are the inputs required for this script?
   - The script requires two inputs: the path to the unstripped shared object file and the path to the stripped shared object file.

3. What external dependencies does this script have?
   - This script depends on the LLVM-based `llvm-objcopy` tool, which is located in the `sbf-sdk/dependencies/sbf-tools/llvm/bin` directory.
