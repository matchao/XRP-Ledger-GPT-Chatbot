The `objcopy.sh` script is a shell script that is used to copy and manipulate object files. The purpose of this script is to provide a convenient way to copy and manipulate object files using the LLVM objcopy tool. 

The script starts by setting the `sbf_sdk` variable to the parent directory of the script file. This is done using the `cd` and `pwd` commands to navigate to the parent directory and get its absolute path. 

Next, the script sources the `env.sh` file located in the `sdk/sbf` directory. This file sets up the environment variables required for the Solana Build Framework (SBF) to function properly. 

Finally, the script executes the `llvm-objcopy` command located in the `sbf-tools/llvm/bin` directory with any arguments passed to the script. This command is used to copy and manipulate object files. 

This script is used in the larger Solana project to provide a convenient way to copy and manipulate object files. For example, it can be used to extract specific sections of an object file or to create a new object file with only the necessary sections. 

Here is an example of how this script can be used to extract a specific section from an object file:

```
./objcopy.sh --dump-section=.text my_object_file.o > my_text_section.txt
```

This command will extract the `.text` section from the `my_object_file.o` object file and save it to a new file called `my_text_section.txt`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to execute the llvm-objcopy command with the arguments passed to it.

2. What is the significance of the `env.sh` file being sourced?

   The `env.sh` file sets up the environment variables required for the script to run correctly.

3. What is the role of `llvm-objcopy` in this script?

   `llvm-objcopy` is a tool used to copy and manipulate object files, and in this script, it is being executed with the arguments passed to it.
