The `install.sh` script is used to install dependencies required by the Solana project. The script creates a `dependencies` directory in the parent directory of the script if it does not exist and then proceeds to download and install the required dependencies.

The script first determines the operating system and architecture of the machine it is running on using the `uname` command. It then sets the appropriate variables based on the detected operating system and architecture. The `download` function is then defined, which takes a URL, filename, and download arguments as input and downloads the file using either `wget` or `curl`. The downloaded file is then extracted using `tar`.

The `get` function is defined next, which takes a version, directory name, and job as input. The function checks if the required files are present in the cache directory and creates a cache directory if they are not present. The function then downloads the required files using the `download` function and moves them to the cache directory.

The script then proceeds to install the required dependencies. The first dependency is Criterion, which is a unit testing framework for C and C++. The script checks the operating system and sets the version of Criterion to download accordingly. The `get` function is then called to download and install Criterion.

The second dependency is Rust-SBF, which is a Rust implementation of the Solana Binary Format (SBF). The script checks if the required files are present in the cache directory and downloads them if they are not present. The script then checks the Rust version and sets up the Rust toolchain.

Finally, the script exits with a status code of 0 if all dependencies were installed successfully.

Example usage:

```
$ cd solana/sdk/sbf/scripts/
$ ./install.sh
```

This will install the required dependencies for the Solana project in the `dependencies` directory.
