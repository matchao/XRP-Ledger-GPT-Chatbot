The `dump.sh` script is a bash script that is used to generate a dump of a compiled SBF program. The purpose of this script is to provide a way to inspect the compiled binary of an SBF program and to generate a human-readable dump of the program's contents. This can be useful for debugging and understanding how the program works.

The script takes two arguments: the path to the compiled SBF program (in the form of a shared object file), and the path to the output file where the dump will be written. If either of these arguments is missing, the script will print an error message and exit.

The script first checks that the SBF program file exists and is readable. If the file is not found or is not readable, the script will print an error message and exit.

Next, the script checks that the `rustfilt` command is available. `rustfilt` is a tool that demangles Rust symbols, making them more readable. If `rustfilt` is not available, the script will print an error message and exit.

The script then creates the output directory if it does not already exist, and generates a mangled dump of the SBF program. The mangled dump contains the output of the `ls` command on the SBF program file, as well as the output of the `llvm-readelf` and `objdump` commands. The `llvm-readelf` command is used to extract information about the program's ELF sections, while the `objdump` command is used to disassemble the program's machine code.

Finally, the script demangles the mangled dump using `rustfilt` and writes the resulting dump to the output file. If the output file is not created successfully, t
