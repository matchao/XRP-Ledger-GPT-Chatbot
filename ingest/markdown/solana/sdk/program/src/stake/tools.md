The `tools.rs` file in the `solana/sdk/program/src/stake` directory contains utility functions that are used by the Solana stake program. The purpose of this code is to provide helper functions for programs to interact with the stake program. 

The first function, `get_minimum_delegation()`, is a helper function that programs can use to call the `GetMinimumDelegation` instruction and fetch the return data. This function performs the cross-program invocation (CPI) to call the `GetMinimumDelegation` function and then calls `get_return_data()` to fetch the return data. The return data is then converted to a `u64` and returned. 

The second function, `get_minimum_delegation_return_data()`, is a helper function that programs can use to get the return data after calling `GetMinimumDelegation`. This function calls `get_return_data()` to fetch the return data, ensures that the result is from the correct program, and returns the correct type. 

The third function, `acceptable_reference_epoch_credits()`, checks if the provided `epoch_credits` demonstrate active voting over the previous `MINIMUM_DELINQUENT_EPOCHS_FOR_DEACTIVATION`. This function takes in an array of tuples containing epoch, credits, and prev_credits, and the current epoch. It then checks if the length of the `epoch_credits` array is greater than or equal to `MINIMUM_DELINQUENT_EPOCHS_FOR_DEACTIVATION`. If it is, it iterates over the last `MINIMUM_DELINQUENT_EPOCHS_FOR_DEACTIVATION` epochs and checks if the epoch in each tuple matches the expected epoch. If all epochs match, the function returns `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`. 

The fourth function, `eligible_for_deactivate_delinquent()`, checks if the provided `epoch_credits` demonstrate delinquency over the previous `MINIMUM_DELINQUENT_EPOCHS_FOR_DEACTIVATION`. This function takes in an array of tuples containing epoch, credits, and prev_credits, and the current epoch. It then checks if the last epoch in the `epoch_credits` array is less than or equal to the minimum epoch required for deactivation. If it is, the function returns `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`. 

The code also includes a test module that contains unit tests for the `acceptable_reference_epoch_credits()` and `eligible_for_deactivate_delinquent()` functions. These tests ensure that the functions are working as expected. 

Overall, this code provides helper functions that can be used by programs to interact with the Solana stake program. The `get_minimum_delegation()` function is used to fetch the minimum delegation value, while the `acceptable_reference_epoch_credits()` and `eligible_for_deactivate_delinquent()` functions are used to check if a validator is eligible for deactivation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_minimum_delegation()` function?
   - The `get_minimum_delegation()` function is a helper function for programs to call `GetMinimumDelegation` and fetch the return data.
2. What is the difference between `acceptable_reference_epoch_credits()` and `eligible_for_deactivate_delinquent()` functions?
   - `acceptable_reference_epoch_credits()` checks if the provided `epoch_credits` demonstrate active voting over the previous `MINIMUM_DELINQUENT_EPOCHS_FOR_DEACTIVATION`, while `eligible_for_deactivate_delinquent()` checks if the provided `epoch_credits` demonstrate delinquency over the previous `MINIMUM_DELINQUENT_EPOCHS_FOR_DEACTIVATION`.
3. What is the purpose of the `tests` module?
   - The `tests` module contains unit tests for the `acceptable_reference_epoch_credits()` and `eligible_for_deactivate_delinquent()` functions.
