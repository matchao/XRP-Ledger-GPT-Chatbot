The `loaded.rs` file defines the `LoadedMessage` and `LoadedAddresses` structures, which are used to represent a version #0 message and its associated loaded addresses. These structures are essential for handling on-chain address lookup tables and managing the read and write permissions of the accounts involved in a transaction.

`LoadedMessage` contains the following fields:
- `message`: A version #0 message that loaded a collection of lookup table addresses.
- `loaded_addresses`: Addresses loaded with on-chain address lookup tables, split by read-only and writable.
- `is_writable_account_cache`: A list of booleans indicating if the corresponding account key is writable or not.

`LoadedAddresses` contains two fields:
- `writable`: A list of addresses for writable loaded accounts.
- `readonly`: A list of addresses for read-only loaded accounts.

The `LoadedMessage` structure provides several methods to interact with the loaded addresses and their permissions, such as:
- `account_keys()`: Returns the full list of static and dynamic account keys that are loaded for this message.
- `has_duplicates()`: Returns true if any account keys are duplicates.
- `is_writable()`: Returns true if the account at the specified index was loaded as writable.
- `is_signer()`: Returns true if the account at the specified index is a signer.
- `is_key_called_as_program()`: Returns true if the account at the specified index is called as a program by an instruction.
- `is_upgradeable_loader_present()`: Returns true if any account is the bpf upgradeable loader.

These methods are useful for validating and processing transactions in the Solana project. For example, `has_duplicates()` can be used to check if a transaction contains duplicate account keys, while `is_writable()` can be used to verify if an account is writable before performing an operation on it.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `LoadedMessage` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `LoadedMessage` struct represents a combination of a version #0 message and its loaded addresses. It is used to store the message, loaded addresses, and a cache of writable account flags for efficient access to the message's properties and account keys.

2. **Question**: How does the `LoadedAddresses` struct work and what is its role in the code?
   **Answer**: The `LoadedAddresses` struct is a collection of addresses loaded from on-chain lookup tables, split by readonly and writable. It is used in the `LoadedMessage` struct to store the loaded addresses separately for writable and read-only accounts, and provides methods to check if the collection is empty and to get the combined length of loaded writable and readonly addresses.

3. **Question**: How does the `is_writable_internal` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `is_writable_internal` function checks if the account at the specified index was loaded as writable. It first checks if the account is writable using the `is_writable_index` function, and then checks if the account key is not a built-in key or sysvar and if the program ID should not be demoted. If all conditions are met, it returns true, indicating that the account is writable.
