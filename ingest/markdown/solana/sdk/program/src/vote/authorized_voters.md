The `authorized_voters.rs` file contains the implementation of the `AuthorizedVoters` struct, which is used to keep track of authorized voters for different epochs. The struct contains a `BTreeMap` that maps epochs to public keys of authorized voters. 

The `AuthorizedVoters` struct has several methods that allow for adding, retrieving, and purging authorized voters. The `new` method is used to create a new `AuthorizedVoters` instance with an initial epoch and public key. The `insert` method is used to add a new authorized voter for a given epoch. The `get_authorized_voter` method is used to retrieve the authorized voter for a given epoch. The `get_and_cache_authorized_voter_for_epoch` method is similar to `get_authorized_voter`, but it also caches the authorized voter if it wasn't already present in the map. The `purge_authorized_voters` method removes all authorized voters for epochs less than the current epoch. 

The struct also has several utility methods such as `is_empty`, `first`, `last`, `len`, and `contains` that respectively check if the map is empty, return the first and last entries in the map, return the length of the map, and check if a given epoch is present in the map. 

The `get_or_calculate_authorized_voter_for_epoch` method is a private method that is used internally to retrieve the authorized voter for a given epoch. If the authorized voter for the given epoch is not present in the map, the method retrieves the authorized voter for the latest epoch before the given epoch. 

Overall, the `AuthorizedVoters` struct is used to manage authorized voters for different epochs in the Solana project. It provides methods for adding, retrieving, and purging authorized voters, as well as utility methods for checking the state of the map.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuthorizedVoters` struct?
- The `AuthorizedVoters` struct is used to keep track of authorized voters for different epochs.

2. What methods are available for interacting with the `AuthorizedVoters` struct?
- Methods available include `new` for creating a new instance, `get_authorized_voter` for getting the authorized voter for a specific epoch, `insert` for inserting a new authorized voter for an epoch, and various other methods for iterating and checking the state of the authorized voters.

3. What is the purpose of the `get_or_calculate_authorized_voter_for_epoch` method?
- The `get_or_calculate_authorized_voter_for_epoch` method returns the authorized voter for a given epoch if it exists, or calculates it based on the latest epoch before the given epoch if it does not exist. It also returns a boolean indicating whether the entry for this epoch exists in the `authorized_voters` map.
