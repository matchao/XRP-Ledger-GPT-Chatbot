The `native_token.rs` file in the Solana project defines the native SOL token and its fractional lamports. The file contains two functions, `lamports_to_sol` and `sol_to_lamports`, which are used to convert between fractional native tokens (lamports) and native tokens (SOL). The file also defines a constant `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL`, which is the number of lamports in one SOL.

The `lamports_to_sol` function takes a `u64` value representing the number of lamports and returns a `f64` value representing the number of SOL. The function divides the number of lamports by `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` and returns the result as a `f64`.

```rust
let lamports = 100_000_000;
let sol = lamports_to_sol(lamports);
println!("{} lamports is approximately {} SOL", lamports, sol);
```

The `sol_to_lamports` function takes a `f64` value representing the number of SOL and returns a `u64` value representing the number of lamports. The function multiplies the number of SOL by `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` and returns the result as a `u64`.

```rust
let sol = 1.23;
let lamports = sol_to_lamports(sol);
println!("{} SOL is approximately {} lamports", sol, lamports);
```

The file also defines a `Sol` struct, which represents a number of SOL as a `u64` value. The `Sol` struct implements the `Display` and `Debug` traits, which allow it to be printed in a human-readable format. The `write_in_sol` method is used to format the `Sol` value as a string with the SOL symbol (`â—Ž`) followed by the integer part of the value and the fractional part of the value with leading zeros.

```rust
let sol = Sol(1_234_567_890);
println!("{} SOL", sol);
```

Overall, this file provides basic functionality for working with the native SOL token in the Solana project. The `lamports_to_sol` and `sol_to_lamports` functions are used to convert between fractional and whole SOL values, while the `Sol` struct provides a convenient way to represent SOL values in a human-readable format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines the conversion rate between the native SOL token and its fractional lamports, and provides functions to convert between the two.

2. What is the significance of the `Sol` struct?
- The `Sol` struct represents a certain amount of SOL tokens in lamports, and provides methods to display the amount in a user-friendly format.

3. Why is `#![allow(clippy::integer_arithmetic)]` used at the beginning of the file?
- This is used to suppress warnings from the Clippy linter related to integer arithmetic, which are not relevant to this code.
