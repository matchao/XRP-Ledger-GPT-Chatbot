This code provides a set of procedural macros for the Solana project to simplify the handling of public keys and program IDs. It allows developers to easily declare and interact with public keys and program IDs in their code.

The main functionality is provided through the following macros:

- `pubkey`: Takes a base58 string representation of a public key and returns a `Pubkey` object.
- `program_pubkey`: Similar to `pubkey`, but returns a `Pubkey` object from the `solana_program` crate.
- `declare_id`: Declares a constant program ID and provides functions to interact with it, such as `check_id` and `id`.
- `declare_deprecated_id`: Similar to `declare_id`, but marks the functions as deprecated.
- `program_declare_id` and `program_declare_deprecated_id`: Same as `declare_id` and `declare_deprecated_id`, but for the `solana_program` crate.
- `pubkeys`: Takes a list of base58 string representations of public keys and returns a vector of `Pubkey` objects.

For example, to declare a program ID using the `declare_id` macro, you would write:

```rust
use solana_sdk::declare_id;

declare_id!("MyProgram1111111111111111111111111111111");
```

This would generate a constant `ID` with the given public key and provide functions like `check_id` and `id` for interacting with it.

The code also includes a `wasm_bindgen_stub` macro to handle WebAssembly bindings and a `CloneZeroed` derive macro to ensure consistent padding across the network when cloning structures.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `parse_id` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `parse_id` function is used to parse a program's ID from the input stream. It checks if the input is a literal string and then parses it as a `LitStr`. If not, it parses the input as an expression. It then checks if there are any unexpected tokens in the input and returns an error if found. The function returns the parsed ID as a `proc_macro2::TokenStream`.

2. **Question**: How does the `parse_pubkey` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `parse_pubkey` function is used to parse a public key from a given literal string (`id_literal`) and a public key type (`pubkey_type`). It first decodes the base58 string representation of the public key and then converts it into a 32-byte array. It then creates a `proc_macro2::TokenStream` containing the public key as a new instance of the given `pubkey_type` with the parsed byte array.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Pubkeys` struct and how is it used in the `pubkeys` proc_macro?
   **Answer**: The `Pubkeys` struct is used to store information about a set of public keys, including the method name, the number of public keys, and the public keys themselves as a `proc_macro2::TokenStream`. It is used in the `pubkeys` proc_macro to generate a function that returns either a single public key or a vector of public keys, depending on the number of public keys provided. The `Pubkeys` struct implements the `Parse` trait for parsing the input stream and the `ToTokens` trait for generating the output tokens.
