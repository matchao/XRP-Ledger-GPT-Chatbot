The `poh_verify.rs` file in the Solana project contains two benchmark tests for verifying the Proof of History (PoH) in a set of entries. The PoH is a cryptographic proof that establishes the order and time of transactions in a blockchain. The purpose of these tests is to measure the performance of verifying the PoH in different scenarios.

The first benchmark test, `bench_poh_verify_ticks`, creates a set of `NUM_ENTRIES` entries, each containing `NUM_HASHES` hashes. It then iterates over the entries and verifies the PoH starting from a zero hash. The `next_entry_mut` function is used to generate each entry, which takes a mutable reference to the current hash and the number of hashes to generate. The `verify` function is called on the resulting vector of entries to check if the PoH is valid. This test is useful for measuring the performance of verifying the PoH in a scenario where there are no transactions in the entries.

The second benchmark test, `bench_poh_verify_transaction_entries`, creates a set of `NUM_ENTRIES` entries, each containing a single transaction. It uses the `system_transaction::transfer` function to create a transfer transaction from a `Keypair` to a `Pubkey`. The resulting vector of transactions is then used to generate each entry using the `next_entry_mut` function. The PoH is verified in the same way as the first test. This test is useful for measuring the performance of verifying the PoH in a scenario where there are transactions in the entries.

Overall, these benchmark tests are important for measuring the performance of verifying the PoH in different scenarios. This information can be used to optimize the PoH verification process in the Solana blockchain, which can improve the overall performance and scalability of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `bench_poh_verify_ticks` function?
- The `bench_poh_verify_ticks` function benchmarks the performance of verifying a vector of `Entry` objects against a starting hash.

2. What is the purpose of the `bench_poh_verify_transaction_entries` function?
- The `bench_poh_verify_transaction_entries` function benchmarks the performance of verifying a vector of `Entry` objects containing transaction entries against a starting hash.

3. What is the significance of the `NUM_HASHES` and `NUM_ENTRIES` constants?
- The `NUM_HASHES` constant determines the number of hashes to generate for each `Entry`, while the `NUM_ENTRIES` constant determines the number of `Entry` objects to create and verify in the benchmark functions. These constants affect the workload and performance of the benchmark.
