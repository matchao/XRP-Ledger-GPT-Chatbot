The `connection_cache.rs` file is part of a connection cache module that manages a pool of connections to remote addresses. The main purpose of this module is to efficiently handle multiple connections to different addresses and maintain a cache of these connections to improve performance.

The `ConnectionCache` struct is the main component of this module, which maintains a map of connections to remote addresses. It uses the `ConnectionManager` trait to create new connection pools and connection configurations. The `ConnectionPool` trait is used to manage a pool of connections for a specific remote address.

The `ConnectionCache` provides methods to create new connections, add connections to the pool, and get connections from the pool. It also handles connection eviction when the cache reaches its maximum size (`MAX_CONNECTIONS`). The cache uses a read-write lock (`RwLock`) to ensure thread safety when accessing the connection map.

The `get_connection` and `get_nonblocking_connection` methods are used to get a connection from the cache. These methods first check if a connection already exists in the cache for the given address. If not, they create a new connection and add it to the cache. They also update the cache statistics, such as cache hits, cache misses, and eviction counts.

Here's an example of how the `ConnectionCache` can be used:

```rust
let connection_manager = MockConnectionManager::default();
let connection_cache = ConnectionCache::new(connection_manager, DEFAULT_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE).unwrap();
let addr = SocketAddr::new(IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::LOCALHOST), 80);

// Get a connection from the cache
let connection = connection_cache.get_connection(&addr);
```

In summary, the connection cache module provides an efficient way to manage multiple connections to remote addresses, improving performance by reusing existing connections and evicting unused ones when necessary.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ConnectionCache` struct and how does it manage connections?
   
   **Answer**: The `ConnectionCache` struct is responsible for managing a cache of connections to remote addresses. It maintains a map of connections indexed by their `SocketAddr` and provides methods to create new connections, add connections to the cache, evict connections when the cache reaches its maximum capacity, and retrieve connections from the cache.

2. **Question**: How does the `ConnectionManager` trait work and what are its associated types?

   **Answer**: The `ConnectionManager` trait defines the interface for managing connections and their associated configuration. It has two associated types: `ConnectionPool` and `NewConnectionConfig`. The trait provides methods to create a new connection pool, create a new connection configuration, and get the port offset for connections.

3. **Question**: How does the `ConnectionPool` trait work and what are its associated types?

   **Answer**: The `ConnectionPool` trait defines the interface for managing a pool of connections. It has two associated types: `NewConnectionConfig` and `BaseClientConnection`. The trait provides methods to add a connection to the pool, get the number of connections in the pool, get a connection by its index, borrow a connection from the pool, check if a new connection is needed, and create a new pool entry.
