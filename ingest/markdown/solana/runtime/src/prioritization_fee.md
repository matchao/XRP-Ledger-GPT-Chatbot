The `prioritization_fee.rs` file in the Solana runtime module is responsible for managing and tracking the prioritization fees of transactions and writable accounts in a block. It provides a way to update and report the minimum prioritization fees for transactions and writable accounts, as well as the metrics related to these fees.

The `PrioritizationFeeMetrics` struct holds various metrics related to prioritization fees, such as the total count of writable accounts, prioritized and non-prioritized transactions, and the minimum and maximum prioritization fees. It also provides methods to update and report these metrics.

The `PrioritizationFee` struct maintains the minimum prioritization fee for a transaction in a block and the minimum fee for each writable account in all transactions in the block. It provides methods to update the minimum transaction fee and the minimum fee for each writable account, prune irrelevant writable accounts, mark a block as completed, and report metrics.

For example, to update the prioritization fee for a transaction and its writable accounts, you can use the `update` method:

```rust
let mut prioritization_fee = PrioritizationFee::default();
prioritization_fee.update(5, &[write_account_a, write_account_b]).unwrap();
```

After updating the fees, you can mark the block as completed and prune irrelevant writable accounts:

```rust
prioritization_fee.mark_block_completed().unwrap();
```

Finally, you can report the metrics for a specific slot:

```rust
prioritization_fee.report_metrics(slot);
```

This code is essential for managing and tracking the prioritization fees in the Solana blockchain, which helps in optimizing transaction processing and resource allocation.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PrioritizationFee` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `PrioritizationFee` struct is used to track the minimum prioritization fee for transactions and writable accounts in a block. It provides methods to update the fees, prune irrelevant writable accounts, mark a block as completed, and report metrics related to prioritization fees.

2. **Question**: How does the `update` method work in the `PrioritizationFee` struct?
   **Answer**: The `update` method takes a transaction fee and a list of writable accounts as input. It updates the minimum transaction fee and the minimum fee for each writable account based on the input transaction fee. It also updates the metrics related to prioritization fees.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts` method in the `PrioritizationFee` struct?
   **Answer**: The `prune_irrelevant_writable_accounts` method removes writable accounts with minimum fees less than or equal to the minimum transaction fee in the block. This is done to reduce memory footprint when the `mark_block_completed` method is called.
