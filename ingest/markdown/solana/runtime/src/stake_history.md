The `StakeHistory` module in the Solana project implements clone-on-write semantics to reduce unnecessary cloning of the underlying vector. This module is used to create a stake history with clone-on-write semantics. The `StakeHistory` struct is the outer type that wraps the `StakeHistoryInner` type, which is the SDK's stake history. The `StakeHistory` struct is derived from `Default`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Debug`, `Deserialize`, `Serialize`, and `AbiExample`. 

The `StakeHistory` struct implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits to allow the user to access the underlying `StakeHistoryInner` type. The `Deref` trait returns a reference to the `StakeHistoryInner` type, while the `DerefMut` trait returns a mutable reference to the `StakeHistoryInner` type. The `DerefMut` trait uses the `Arc::make_mut` method to create a mutable reference to the underlying `StakeHistoryInner` type. 

The `StakeHistoryInner` type is the SDK's stake history, which is a vector of `StakeHistoryEntry` structs. The `StakeHistoryEntry` struct contains information about the stake for a particular epoch, including the effective stake, activating stake, and deactivating stake. 

The `tests` module contains two tests. The first test ensures that `StakeHistory` is indeed clone-on-write. The test clones the stake history and asserts that the underlying instances are the same. The test then clones the stake history and modifies it, asserting that the underlying instances are unique. The second test ensures that `StakeHistory` serializes and deserializes between the inner and outer types. The test creates a stake history and serializes it to both the outer and inner types. The test then deserializes the data and asserts that the deserialized data matches the original stake history. 

Overall, the `StakeHistory` module is used to create a stake history with clone-on-write semantics, which reduces unnecessary cloning of the underlying vector. This module is used in the larger Solana project to manage stake history data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StakeHistory` struct and how does it differ from the `StakeHistoryInner` type?
- The `StakeHistory` struct implements clone-on-write semantics to reduce unnecessary cloning of the underlying vector, while `StakeHistoryInner` is the SDK's stake history type.
2. How does the `Deref` implementation work for `StakeHistory`?
- The `Deref` implementation returns a reference to the `StakeHistoryInner` type, allowing access to its methods and fields.
3. What are the tests in the `tests` module checking for?
- The tests are checking that `StakeHistory` is indeed clone-on-write and that it can be serialized and deserialized between the inner and outer types.
