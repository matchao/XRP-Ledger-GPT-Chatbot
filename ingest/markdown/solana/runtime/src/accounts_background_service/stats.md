The `StatsManager` struct and `Stats` struct in `stats.rs` are used to record and manage statistics for the Accounts Background Service (ABS) in the Solana project. The ABS is responsible for processing and updating accounts in the Solana blockchain. The purpose of the `StatsManager` is to record the statistics for each iteration of the ABS main loop and submit the datapoints to the Solana metrics system at regular intervals. 

The `StatsManager` struct contains a `Stats` struct and a `previous_submit` field of type `Instant`. The `Stats` struct contains fields to record the number of iterations, cumulative runtime, minimum runtime, and maximum runtime. The `StatsManager` struct has two methods: `new()` and `record_and_maybe_submit()`. The `new()` method creates a new `StatsManager` with default values for the `Stats` struct and sets the `previous_submit` field to the current time. The `record_and_maybe_submit()` method records the runtime of the current iteration of the ABS main loop and calls the `maybe_submit()` method to check if it is time to submit the datapoints to the metrics system. 

The `maybe_submit()` method checks if the time since the previous submission is greater than or equal to 60 seconds (the `SUBMIT_INTERVAL` constant). If it is, then it submits the datapoints to the metrics system using the `datapoint_info!()` macro from the `solana_metrics` crate. The datapoints include the duration since the previous submission, the number of iterations, the cumulative runtime, the mean runtime, the minimum runtime, and the maximum runtime. After submitting the datapoints, the `StatsManager` is reset to default values using the `new()` method.

The `Stats` struct has three methods: `record()`, `mean_runtime()`, and `default()`. The `record()` method is called by the `record_and_maybe_submit()` method of the `StatsManager` struct to record the runtime of the current iteration. It updates the fields of the `Stats` struct accordingly. The `mean_runtime()` method calculates the mean runtime of all iterations recorded by dividing the cumulative runtime by the number of iterations. It includes debug assertions to ensure that the number of iterations is greater than zero and less than or equal to the maximum value of a `u32`. The `default()` method creates a new `Stats` struct with default values for all fields.

The `StatsManager` and `Stats` structs are used in the ABS main loop to record and submit statistics to the Solana metrics system. The statistics can be used to monitor the performance of the ABS and identify areas for improvement. The `StatsManager` can be used in other parts of the Solana project or in other projects to record and submit statistics to the metrics system. 

Example usage:

```
let mut stats_manager = StatsManager::new();
loop {
    let start_time = Instant::now();
    // ABS main loop code
    let runtime = start_time.elapsed();
    stats_manager.record_and_maybe_submit(runtime);
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StatsManager` struct?
- The `StatsManager` struct is used to manage the stats for the Accounts Background Service and record the stats for each iteration of the ABS main loop.

2. What is the purpose of the `maybe_submit` function?
- The `maybe_submit` function is used to submit the datapoints based on how long it has been since the previous submission.

3. What is the purpose of the `Stats` struct?
- The `Stats` struct is used to record the stats for each iteration of the ABS main loop, including the number of iterations recorded, the total runtime of all iterations, the minimum runtime seen for one iteration, and the maximum runtime seen for one iteration.
