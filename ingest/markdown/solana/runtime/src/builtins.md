The `builtins.rs` file contains code that defines and manages the built-in programs of the Solana blockchain. Built-in programs are programs that are always available on the blockchain and are used to perform specific functions. The file defines two structs, `Builtin` and `Builtins`, and three enums, `BuiltinAction`, `BuiltinFeatureTransition`, and `AbiExample`.

The `Builtin` struct defines a built-in program and contains the name of the program, its public key, and a function that processes instructions for the program. The `Builtins` struct contains two fields: `genesis_builtins` and `feature_transitions`. `genesis_builtins` is a vector of built-in programs that are always available on the blockchain, while `feature_transitions` is a vector of built-in programs that are activated when certain features are enabled.

The `BuiltinFeatureTransition` enum defines the state transitions for adding and removing built-in programs through feature activations. It has two variants: `Add` and `RemoveOrRetain`. The `Add` variant adds a built-in program if a feature is activated, while the `RemoveOrRetain` variant removes a built-in program if a feature is activated or retains a previously added built-in program.

The `BuiltinAction` enum defines the actions taken by a bank when managing the list of active built-in programs. It has two variants: `Add` and `Remove`. The `Add` variant adds a built-in program to the list, while the `Remove` variant removes a built-in program from the list.

The `AbiExample` trait is used for serialization and deserialization of the `Builtin` struct.

The `get()` function returns a `Builtins` struct that contains the list of built-in programs. The `get_pubkeys()` function returns the public keys of all built-in programs.

This code is used to manage the built-in programs of the Solana blockchain. It allows for the addition and removal of built-in programs based on feature activations and provides a way to retrieve the public keys of all built-in programs. Developers can use this code to create new built-in programs or modify existing ones. For example, a developer could create a new built-in program that performs a specific function and
