The `builtins.rs` file contains code that defines and manages the built-in programs of the Solana blockchain. Built-in programs are programs that are always available on the blockchain and are used to perform specific functions. The file defines two structs, `Builtin` and `Builtins`, and three enums, `BuiltinAction`, `BuiltinFeatureTransition`, and `AbiExample`.

The `Builtin` struct defines a built-in program and contains the name of the program, its public key, and a function that processes instructions for the program. The `Builtins` struct contains two fields: `genesis_builtins` and `feature_transitions`. `genesis_builtins` is a vector of built-in programs that are always available on the blockchain, while `feature_transitions` is a vector of built-in programs that are activated when certain features are enabled.

The `BuiltinFeatureTransition` enum defines the state transitions for adding and removing built-in programs through feature activations. It has two variants: `Add` and `RemoveOrRetain`. The `Add` variant adds a built-in program if a feature is activated, while the `RemoveOrRetain` variant removes a built-in program if a feature is activated or retains a previously added built-in program.

The `BuiltinAction` enum defines the actions taken by a bank when managing the list of active built-in programs. It has two variants: `Add` and `Remove`. The `Add` variant adds a built-in program to the list, while the `Remove` variant removes a built-in program from the list.

The `AbiExample` trait is used for serialization and deserialization of the `Builtin` struct.

The `get()` function returns a `Builtins` struct that contains the list of built-in programs. The `get_pubkeys()` function returns the public keys of all built-in programs.

This code is used to manage the built-in programs of the Solana blockchain. It allows for the addition and removal of built-in programs based on feature activations and provides a way to retrieve the public keys of all built-in programs. Developers can use this code to create new built-in programs or modify existing ones. For example, a developer could create a new built-in program that performs a specific function and add it to the list of built-in programs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Builtin` struct and how is it used?
- The `Builtin` struct represents a built-in program in Solana and contains its name, ID, and a function for processing instructions. It is used to create a list of built-in programs that are always available and can be added or removed dynamically based on feature activations.

2. What is the `BuiltinFeatureTransition` enum and how is it used?
- The `BuiltinFeatureTransition` enum represents a state transition for adding or removing a built-in program based on feature activations. It contains variants for adding a program, removing a program, or retaining a previously added program. It is used to create a list of dynamic feature transitions for built-in programs.

3. What built-in programs are included in the `genesis_builtins` function?
- The `genesis_builtins` function returns a vector of `Builtin` structs for the system program, vote program, stake program, and config program. These programs are always available in Solana and can be used to perform basic system functions, voting, staking, and configuration.
