The `bank_client.rs` file defines the `BankClient` struct and its associated methods for interacting with the Solana bank. The `BankClient` struct contains an `Arc<Bank>` reference and a `Mutex<Sender<VersionedTransaction>>`. The `Arc<Bank>` allows multiple threads to share the same bank reference, while the `Mutex<Sender<VersionedTransaction>>` ensures thread-safe access to the transaction sender.

The `BankClient` implements three traits: `Client`, `AsyncClient`, and `SyncClient`. These traits provide methods for sending and confirming transactions, querying account information, and interacting with the bank.

The `AsyncClient` trait implementation provides the `async_send_versioned_transaction` method, which sends a transaction asynchronously. The `SyncClient` trait implementation provides various methods for sending and confirming transactions, such as `send_and_confirm_message`, `send_and_confirm_instruction`, and `transfer_and_confirm`. It also provides methods for querying account information, such as `get_account_data`, `get_account`, `get_balance`, and `get_minimum_balance_for_rent_exemption`.

The `BankClient` struct also provides a `run` method, which processes transactions received from the `transaction_receiver`. The `new_shared` method creates a new `BankClient` instance with a shared `Arc<Bank>` reference and spawns a thread to run the `run` method. The `new` method creates a new `BankClient` instance with a new `Bank`.

In addition, the `BankClient` provides a `set_sysvar_for_tests` method for setting sysvars during testing.

The `tests` module contains a test for the `BankClient` that demonstrates how to create a multisig transfer instruction and send it using the `send_and_confirm_message` method.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: How does the `BankClient` handle transaction processing and what is the purpose of the `run` function?
   **Answer**: The `BankClient` processes transactions by sending them through a crossbeam channel. The `run` function is responsible for receiving transactions from the channel and processing them in the associated `Bank` instance.

2. **Question**: How does the `BankClient` handle commitment configurations in its methods, such as `get_account_with_commitment` and `get_balance_with_commitment`?
   **Answer**: Currently, the `BankClient` does not utilize the commitment configurations in these methods. The `_commitment_config` parameter is present but not used in the method implementations.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `set_sysvar_for_tests` function in the `BankClient` implementation?
   **Answer**: The `set_sysvar_for_tests` function is used to set a specific sysvar (system variable) in the `Bank` instance associated with the `BankClient`. This is useful for testing purposes, allowing tests to set specific sysvar values to test different scenarios.
