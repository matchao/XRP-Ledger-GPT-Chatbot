The `status_cache.rs` file defines a `StatusCache` struct that stores the status of keys in a Solana runtime. The cache is organized by blockhash, slot, and key slice. It is designed to efficiently look up the status of a key in a specific fork or across all forks. The cache is also capable of serializing its contents for snapshotting purposes.

The `StatusCache` struct contains three main fields:

1. `cache`: A `KeyStatusMap` that maps a blockhash to a tuple containing the highest slot it's been observed on, the key offset, and a `KeyMap` that maps a key slice to a `ForkStatus`.
2. `roots`: A `HashSet` of root slots.
3. `slot_deltas`: A `SlotDeltaMap` that maps a slot to a `Status`.

The `StatusCache` provides several methods for interacting with the cache:

- `get_status`: Given a key, blockhash, and a set of ancestors, it returns the status of the key in the specified fork, if it exists.
- `get_status_any_blockhash`: Given a key and a set of ancestors, it returns the status of the key in any fork, if it exists.
- `add_root`: Adds a root slot to the cache. If the number of roots exceeds `MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES`, the oldest root is removed, and any old keys are cleared.
- `insert`: Inserts a new key for a specific slot.
- `clear_slot_entries`: Removes all entries associated with a specific slot.
- `root_slot_deltas`: Returns the statuses for all root slots.
- `append`: Appends the given slot deltas to the cache.
- `from_slot_deltas`: Constructs a new `StatusCache` from the given slot deltas.

The `StatusCache` is used in the larger Solana project to efficiently manage and query the status of keys in the runtime. It is particularly useful for handling forks and snapshots.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `StatusCache` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `StatusCache` struct is used to store and manage the status of keys (such as signatures) in a fork-aware manner. It allows for efficient lookups of key statuses based on blockhashes and ancestors, as well as managing roots and purging old entries when necessary.

2. **Question**: What is the significance of the `MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES` constant and how does it relate to `MAX_RECENT_BLOCKHASHES`?
   **Answer**: `MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES` is the maximum number of root entries that the status cache can store. It is set to be equal to `MAX_RECENT_BLOCKHASHES`, which is the maximum number of recent blockhashes that can be tracked. This ensures that the status cache does not grow indefinitely and maintains a reasonable size.

3. **Question**: How does the `StatusCache` handle different sized keys, and what is the purpose of the random key offset?
   **Answer**: The `StatusCache` can handle different sized keys by using a random key offset for each blockhash. This allows for shorter keys to still be used even if the offset is greater than the key length. The random key offset helps in distributing the keys more evenly in the cache, improving the overall performance of lookups.
