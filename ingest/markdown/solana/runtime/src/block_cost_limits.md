This file defines various static configurations and statically computed data related to block cost limits in the Solana blockchain. The purpose of this code is to set limits on the amount of computation that can be performed in a block, in order to prevent abuse and ensure the stability and security of the network.

The code defines constants such as `MAX_BLOCK_REPLAY_TIME_US` and `MAX_CONCURRENCY` to set limits on the time and number of concurrent processes allowed for replaying a block. It also defines constants such as `COMPUTE_UNIT_TO_US_RATIO` and `SIGNATURE_COST` to set limits on the number of compute units required for various operations such as signature verification and write locks.

The code also defines a `HashMap` called `BUILT_IN_INSTRUCTION_COSTS` that maps built-in program IDs to their respective compute unit costs. This allows for easy lookup of the compute unit cost of a given program during transaction processing.

Finally, the code defines constants such as `MAX_BLOCK_UNITS` and `MAX_VOTE_UNITS` to set limits on the total number of compute units allowed for a block and for vote transactions within a block, respectively. These limits help ensure that the network remains stable and secure by preventing excessive computation and parallelism.

Overall, this code plays an important role in setting limits on the amount of computation that can be performed in the Solana blockchain, and helps ensure the stability and security of the network. Below is an example of how the `BUILT_IN_INSTRUCTION_COSTS` map can be used to look up the compute unit cost of the system program:

```
use solana_sdk::system_program;

let system_program_cost = *block_cost_limits::BUILT_IN_INSTRUCTION_COSTS.get(&system_program::id()).unwrap();
println!("System program cost: {}", system_program_cost);
```
