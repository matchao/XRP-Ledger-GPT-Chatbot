The `PubkeyBinCalculator24` struct and its methods are used to calculate a bin number for a given `Pubkey` and to convert a bin number back to the lowest `Pubkey` in that bin. This is useful for partitioning a large set of `Pubkey`s into smaller bins for more efficient processing. 

The `new` method creates a new `PubkeyBinCalculator24` instance with a specified number of bins. It checks that the number of bins is a power of two and less than or equal to 2^24. It then calculates the number of bits to shift away from the first 2 bytes of the `Pubkey` to ignore when calculating the bin number. This is done by finding the log base 2 of the number of bins and subtracting it from 24 (the number of bits in the first 3 bytes of a `Pubkey`).

The `bin_from_pubkey` method takes a `Pubkey` and returns the bin number it belongs to. It does this by taking the first 3 bytes of the `Pubkey`, shifting away the number of bits calculated in the `new` method, and dividing by the size of each bin.

The `lowest_pubkey_from_bin` method takes a bin number and the total number of bins and returns the lowest `Pubkey` in that bin. It does this by shifting the bin number left by the number of bits calculated in the `new` method, and then setting the first 3 bytes of a new `Pubkey` to the appropriate values based on the shifted bin number.

The `tests` module contains unit tests for the `PubkeyBinCalculator24` methods. These tests cover edge cases for the number of bins, the size of each bin, and the values of the `Pubkey`s. They ensure that the methods behave correctly and that the calculated bin numbers and lowest `Pubkey`s are accurate.

Example usage:
```
let bins = 16;
let calc = PubkeyBinCalculator24::new(bins);
let pubkey = Pubkey::new_unique();
let bin = calc.bin_from_pubkey(&pubkey);
let lowest_pubkey = calc.lowest_pubkey_from_bin(bin, bins);
println!("Bin number: {}", bin);
println!("Lowest pubkey in bin: {}", lowest_pubkey);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a struct `PubkeyBinCalculator24` and its methods that are used to calculate a bin number from a given public key and vice versa.

2. What is the significance of the number 24 in the struct and method names?
- The number 24 refers to the number of bits used to calculate the bin number from the first 3 bytes of a public key. It is also the maximum number of bits that can be used for this purpose.

3. What are the tests checking for?
- The tests are checking that the `PubkeyBinCalculator24` methods are working correctly for different numbers of bins and different ranges of public keys. They are also checking that the constructor panics when given invalid input.
