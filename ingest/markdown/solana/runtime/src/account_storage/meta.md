The `meta.rs` file in the `solana/runtime/src/account_storage` directory contains code that is responsible for storing and retrieving account information in Solana. The purpose of this code is to eliminate copies and data reshaping given various code paths that store accounts. The `StorableAccountsWithHashesAndWriteVersions` struct contains what is needed to store accounts to a storage. It has three fields: accounts, hashes_and_write_versions, and _phantom. The accounts field is a reference to the accounts to store, which always has a pubkey and account and may also have a hash and write_version per account. The hashes_and_write_versions field is an optional field that contains a hash and write version per account if the accounts do not have them. The _phantom field is a marker that indicates that the struct is covariant over the lifetime of the account.

The `StoredAccountMeta` enum contains references to account data stored elsewhere. Getting an `Account` requires cloning. The `StoredMeta` struct contains enough context to recover the index from storage itself. It has three fields: write_version_obsolete, data_len, and pubkey. The `AccountMeta` struct contains information about an account, such as the lamports in the account, the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, the program that owns this account, and whether this account's data contains a loaded program.

The code in this file is used to store and retrieve account information in Solana. It is used in the larger project to ensure that the data layout is stable and consistent across the entire cluster. The `StorableAccountsWithHashesAndWriteVersions` struct is used to store accounts to a storage, while the `StoredAccountMeta` enum is used to reference account data stored elsewhere. The `StoredMeta` struct contains enough context to recover the index from storage itself, while the `AccountMeta` struct contains information about an account. Overall, this code is an essential part of Solana's account storage system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StorableAccountsWithHashesAndWriteVersions` struct?
- The struct is used to store accounts to a storage and contains what is needed to do so, including the account and pubkey, hash per account, and write version per account.

2. What is the purpose of the `StoredAccountMeta` enum?
- The enum contains references to account data stored elsewhere and provides methods to access various fields of the account data.

3. What is the purpose of the `StoredMeta` struct?
- The struct contains enough context to recover the index from storage itself and will be backed by mmaped and snapshotted data files. It includes the global write version and key for the account.
