The code in this file contains two test functions that test the behavior of the `Bank` struct in the Solana runtime. The `Bank` struct represents a bank in the Solana network and is responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the ledger. The tests focus on the application of built-in program feature transitions and starting up a bank from a snapshot.

The first test function, `test_apply_builtin_program_feature_transitions_for_new_epoch`, simulates the crossing of an epoch boundary for a new bank. It creates a new `Bank` instance using a `genesis_config` and sets the `feature_set` to enable all features. It then overwrites the precompile accounts to simulate a cluster that has already added precompiles. Precompiles are programs that are executed on the Solana runtime before the transaction is processed. The function then freezes the bank and applies the built-in program feature transitions for new features. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the bank can handle feature transitions correctly when crossing an epoch boundary.

The second test function, `test_startup_from_snapshot_after_precompile_transition`, simulates starting up a bank from a snapshot after a precompile transition. It creates a new `Bank` instance using a `genesis_config` and sets the `feature_set` to enable all features. It then overwrites the precompile accounts to simulate a cluster that has already added precompiles. The function then freezes the bank and finishes the initialization for a frozen bank. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the bank can start up correctly from a snapshot after a precompile transition.

Overall, these test functions ensure that the `Bank` struct can handle feature transitions and starting up from a snapshot correctly. These are critical functions for the Solana runtime, and ensuring their correctness is essential for maintaining the integrity of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `test_apply_builtin_program_feature_transitions_for_new_epoch` function?
   
   This function tests the application of built-in program feature transitions for a new epoch in a bank, by simulating the addition of precompiled accounts and freezing the bank before applying the transitions.

2. What is the purpose of the `test_startup_from_snapshot_after_precompile_transition` function?
   
   This function tests the startup from a snapshot and finishing the initialization for a frozen bank, after simulating the addition of precompiled accounts.

3. What is the significance of the `FeatureSet` and `create_genesis_config` types from `solana_sdk` used in these tests?
   
   The `FeatureSet` type represents a set of enabled features for a Solana cluster, while `create_genesis_config` is a function that creates a genesis configuration for a new Solana cluster. These types are used to initialize the `Bank` instance for testing purposes.
