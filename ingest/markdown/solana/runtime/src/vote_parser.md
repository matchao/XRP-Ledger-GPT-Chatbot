The `vote_parser.rs` file contains functions for parsing vote transactions in the Solana blockchain. The `parse_sanitized_vote_transaction` function is used for locally forwarding processed vote transactions to consensus, while `parse_vote_transaction` is used for parsing gossip vote transactions.

Both functions check the first instruction of the transaction to determine if it is a vote instruction. If it is not, the function returns `None`. If it is a vote instruction, the function extracts the necessary information from the instruction and returns a `ParsedVote` tuple containing the voter's public key, the vote transaction, the switch proof hash (if applicable), and the signature.

The `parse_vote_instruction_data` function is called by both `parse_sanitized_vote_transaction` and `parse_vote_transaction` to extract the vote transaction and switch proof hash from the instruction data. The function uses the `limited_deserialize` function from the Solana SDK to deserialize the instruction data into a `VoteInstruction` enum. The function then matches on the enum to extract the necessary information.

The `test` module contains a unit test for `parse_vote_transaction`. The test creates a new vote transaction and verifies that the parsed `ParsedVote` tuple contains the correct information. The test also verifies that the function returns `None` if the program ID is invalid.

Overall, these functions are important for processing and verifying vote transactions in the Solana blockchain. They are used by the consensus algorithm to determine the state of the network and reach consensus on the next block.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `parse_sanitized_vote_transaction` function?
- The `parse_sanitized_vote_transaction` function is used for locally forwarding processed vote transactions to consensus.

2. What is the difference between the `parse_sanitized_vote_transaction` and `parse_vote_transaction` functions?
- The `parse_sanitized_vote_transaction` function is used for parsing sanitized vote transactions, while the `parse_vote_transaction` function is used for parsing gossip vote transactions.

3. What is the purpose of the `parse_vote_instruction_data` function?
- The `parse_vote_instruction_data` function is used for parsing the data of a vote instruction and returning a tuple containing a `VoteTransaction` and an optional `Hash`.
