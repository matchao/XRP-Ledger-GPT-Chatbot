The `snapshot_hash.rs` file contains helper types and functions for handling and dealing with snapshot hashes in the Solana project. Snapshot hashes are used to represent the state of the blockchain at a particular point in time, and are used to create and verify snapshots of the blockchain.

The file defines several structs, including `StartingSnapshotHashes`, `FullSnapshotHash`, `IncrementalSnapshotHash`, `FullSnapshotHashes`, and `IncrementalSnapshotHashes`. These structs are used to wrap up snapshot hash values and make it easier to pass them between different parts of the Solana codebase.

The `SnapshotHash` struct represents the hash used for snapshot archives. It contains a single field, which is a `Hash` value.

The `SnapshotHash` struct also defines a `new` method, which is used to create a new snapshot hash from an `AccountsHashEnum` and an optional `EpochAccountsHash`. The `AccountsHashEnum` represents the hash of all the accounts in the blockchain, while the `EpochAccountsHash` represents the hash of all the accounts in a particular epoch. If an `EpochAccountsHash` is provided, the `new` method combines the two hashes using a `Hasher` and returns the resulting snapshot hash.

Overall, the code in this file provides a way to create and manage snapshot hashes in the Solana project. These snapshot hashes are used to create and verify snapshots of the blockchain, which can be used to speed up syncing and reduce storage requirements. The structs defined in this file make it easier to pass snapshot hash values between different parts of the Solana codebase, and the `new` method of the `SnapshotHash` struct provides a way to create snapshot hashes from account hashes and epoch account hashes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StartingSnapshotHashes` struct?
- The `StartingSnapshotHashes` struct is used to wrap the starting snapshot hashes at startup, making it easier to pass them from `bank_forks_utils` through the validator to `SnapshotPackagerService`.

2. What is the difference between `FullSnapshotHash` and `IncrementalSnapshotHash`?
- `FullSnapshotHash` is used to ensure a full snapshot hash is pushed to the right CRDS, while `IncrementalSnapshotHash` is used to ensure an incremental snapshot hash is pushed to the right CRDS. The `base` field in `IncrementalSnapshotHash` represents the full snapshot that the incremental snapshot is based on.

3. What is the purpose of the `SnapshotHash` struct and its `new` method?
- The `SnapshotHash` struct represents the hash used for snapshot archives. Its `new` method is used to create a snapshot hash from an accounts hash and epoch accounts hash, hashing them together using a `Hasher` instance.
