The `epoch_stakes.rs` file contains the implementation of the `EpochStakes` struct and related types and methods. The purpose of this code is to manage the stakes and vote accounts for a given epoch in the Solana blockchain. 

The `EpochStakes` struct contains four fields: `stakes`, `total_stake`, `node_id_to_vote_accounts`, and `epoch_authorized_voters`. The `stakes` field is an `Arc`-wrapped `StakesEnum` object, which represents the stakes for the epoch. The `total_stake` field is the total stake for the epoch. The `node_id_to_vote_accounts` field is a `HashMap` that maps a node's public key to its vote accounts and total stake. The `epoch_authorized_voters` field is a `HashMap` that maps a vote account's public key to its authorized voter's public key.

The `EpochStakes` struct has several methods. The `new` method creates a new `EpochStakes` object given a `StakesEnum` object and the epoch's leader schedule epoch. The `stakes`, `total_stake`, `node_id_to_vote_accounts`, and `epoch_authorized_voters` methods return the corresponding fields of the `EpochStakes` object. The `vote_account_stake` method returns the stake for a given vote account.

The `parse_epoch_vote_accounts` function is a private helper function that takes a `VoteAccountsHashMap` object and the epoch's leader schedule epoch and returns the total stake, `NodeIdToVoteAccounts` object, and `EpochAuthorizedVoters` object. The `NodeIdToVoteAccounts` object is a `HashMap` that maps a node's public key to its vote accounts and total stake. The `EpochAuthorizedVoters` object is a `HashMap` that maps a vote account's public key to its authorized voter's public key.

The `tests` module contains a single test function that tests the `parse_epoch_vote_accounts` function. It creates some vote accounts for each pubkey, processes them, and verifies the results.

Overall, this code provides a way to manage the stakes and vote accounts for a given epoch in the Solana blockchain. It can be used by other parts of the Solana project that need to access or manipulate the stakes and vote accounts for a given epoch.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EpochStakes` struct?
- The `EpochStakes` struct represents the stakes of all the nodes in a particular epoch, along with their authorized voters.

2. What is the significance of the `node_id_to_vote_accounts` field?
- The `node_id_to_vote_accounts` field is a mapping of node public keys to their corresponding vote accounts and total stake.

3. What is the purpose of the `parse_epoch_vote_accounts` function?
- The `parse_epoch_vote_accounts` function takes in a map of vote accounts and their stakes, and returns the total stake, a mapping of node public keys to their vote accounts and total stake, and a mapping of vote account public keys to their authorized voters for the given epoch.
