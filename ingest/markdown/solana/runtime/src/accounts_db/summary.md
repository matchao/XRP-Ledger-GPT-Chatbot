The `geyser_plugin_utils.rs` file is part of the Solana runtime and plays a crucial role in notifying plugins about account updates and account restoration from snapshots. It is particularly useful in keeping plugins informed about the state of accounts in the Solana blockchain.

The file defines a struct `GeyserPluginNotifyAtSnapshotRestoreStats` that stores statistics related to account restoration. This struct is used to report these statistics, ensuring that plugins are aware of the current state of account restoration.

The `AccountsDb` struct is extended with methods to notify plugins about account updates and account restoration from snapshots. For instance, the `notify_account_restore_from_snapshot` method is called when the `AccountsDb` is restored from a snapshot. This method iterates through all the slots in reverse order and notifies the plugins about the accounts in each slot. It ensures that an account is only streamed once and only the last write (with the highest write_version) is notified.

Another method, `notify_account_at_accounts_update`, is called when an account is updated at runtime due to transaction activities. This method notifies the plugins about the account update by calling the `notify_account_update` method of the notifier.

Additionally, the `notify_accounts_in_slot` and `notify_filtered_accounts` methods are helper methods used by `notify_account_restore_from_snapshot` to filter and notify accounts in a specific slot.

The code also includes tests to ensure that the notification system works as expected. These tests cover scenarios such as:

- Notifying accounts restored from snapshots once per slot
- Notifying accounts restored from snapshots once across slots
- Notifying accounts at accounts update

These tests help ensure that the notification system is robust and reliable, allowing developers to trust that their plugins will receive accurate and timely information about account updates and restoration.

In summary, the `geyser_plugin_utils.rs` file is an essential part of the Solana runtime, providing a reliable notification system for plugins to stay informed about account updates and restoration from snapshots. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Solana blockchain and ensuring that plugins can accurately track the state of accounts.
