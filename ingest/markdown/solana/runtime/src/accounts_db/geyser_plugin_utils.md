The code in `geyser_plugin_utils.rs` is part of the Solana runtime and is responsible for notifying plugins about account updates and account restoration from snapshots. It defines a struct `GeyserPluginNotifyAtSnapshotRestoreStats` to store statistics related to account restoration and provides methods to report these statistics.

The `AccountsDb` struct is extended with methods to notify plugins about account updates and account restoration from snapshots. The `notify_account_restore_from_snapshot` method is called when the `AccountsDb` is restored from a snapshot. It iterates through all the slots in reverse order and notifies the plugins about the accounts in each slot. The method ensures that an account is only streamed once and only the last write (with the highest write_version) is notified.

The `notify_account_at_accounts_update` method is called when an account is updated at runtime due to transaction activities. It notifies the plugins about the account update by calling the `notify_account_update` method of the notifier.

The `notify_accounts_in_slot` and `notify_filtered_accounts` methods are helper methods used by `notify_account_restore_from_snapshot` to filter and notify accounts in a specific slot.

The code also includes tests to ensure that the notification system works as expected. The tests cover scenarios such as notifying accounts restored from snapshots once per slot, notifying accounts restored from snapshots once across slots, and notifying accounts at accounts update.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `GeyserPluginNotifyAtSnapshotRestoreStats` struct and its `report` method?
   **Answer**: The `GeyserPluginNotifyAtSnapshotRestoreStats` struct is used to store various statistics related to the notification process during snapshot restoration. The `report` method is responsible for logging these statistics using the `datapoint_info!` macro, which sends the data to the metrics system for monitoring and analysis.

2. **Question**: How does the `notify_account_restore_from_snapshot` method work, and when is it called?
   **Answer**: The `notify_account_restore_from_snapshot` method is called when the AccountsDb is restored from a snapshot. It iterates through all the slots in reverse order and notifies the plugins about the account data. The method ensures that an account is only streamed once, and if an account is updated multiple times within a slot, only the last write (with the highest write_version) is notified.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `notify_account_at_accounts_update` method, and how is it used?
   **Answer**: The `notify_account_at_accounts_update` method is responsible for notifying the plugins when an account is updated at runtime due to transaction activities. It takes the slot, account, transaction, pubkey, and write_version_producer as input parameters and calls the `notify_account_update` method of the notifier if an `accounts_update_notifier` is present. This allows the plugins to react to account updates in real-time.
