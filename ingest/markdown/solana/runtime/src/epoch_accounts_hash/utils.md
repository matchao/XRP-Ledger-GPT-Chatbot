The `utils.rs` file in the `solana/runtime/src/epoch_accounts_hash` directory contains utility functions and types for Epoch Accounts Hash (EAH). EAH is a feature that enables the calculation of a hash of all accounts in a bank at a specific slot. This hash is then stored in the bank's header and can be used to verify the integrity of the accounts in the bank.

The `is_enabled_this_epoch` function determines whether EAH is enabled for the current epoch. The function calculates the minimum calculation interval required for EAH to be enabled and compares it to the actual calculation interval. If the actual calculation interval is greater than or equal to the minimum calculation interval, EAH is enabled.

The `calculation_offset_start` function returns the slot at which the EAH calculation starts. The `calculation_offset_stop` function returns the slot at which the EAH calculation stops. The `calculation_start` function returns the absolute slot where the EAH calculation starts, and the `calculation_stop` function returns the absolute slot where the EAH calculation stops. The `calculation_interval` function returns the number of slots from the EAH calculation start to stop.

The `is_in_calculation_window` function determines whether a bank is in the calculation window for EAH. The function checks whether the bank's slot is within the range of slots between the EAH calculation start and stop slots.

The `calculation_info` function returns all the EAH calculation information for a specific epoch. The function calculates the EAH calculation start and stop slots based on the epoch's slots per epoch and returns the calculation information in a `CalculationInfo` struct.

The `CalculationInfo` struct contains the values that were looked up and needed to get the calculation info, such as the epoch, number of slots in the epoch, first and last slots in the epoch, and the computed values for the calculation info, such as the EAH calculation start and stop slots, absolute slots where the EAH calculation starts and stops, and the number of slots from EAH calculation start to stop.

The `tests` module contains unit tests for the functions in the file. The tests cover the minimum and maximum slots per epoch, calculation offset bounds, calculation bounds, and calculation info.

Overall, the `utils.rs` file provides utility functions and types for EAH, which is a feature that enables the calculation of a hash of all accounts in a bank at a specific slot. The functions in the file are used to determine whether EAH is enabled, calculate the EAH calculation start and stop slots, and check whether a bank is in the calculation window for EAH. The `CalculationInfo` struct contains all the EAH calculation information for a specific epoch.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `is_enabled_this_epoch` function?
- The `is_enabled_this_epoch` function determines whether the Epoch Accounts Hash (EAH) calculation is enabled for the current epoch based on the bank's state and configuration.

2. What is the significance of the `calculation_offset_start` and `calculation_offset_stop` values?
- The `calculation_offset_start` and `calculation_offset_stop` values represent the offsets into the epoch at which the EAH calculation starts and stops, respectively. All nodes in the cluster must agree on these values.

3. What is the purpose of the `calculation_info` function?
- The `calculation_info` function computes and returns all the EAH calculation information for a specific epoch, including the start and stop slots, the calculation interval, and other related values.
