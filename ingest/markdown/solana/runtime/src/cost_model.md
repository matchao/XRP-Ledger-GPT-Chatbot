The `cost_model.rs` file in the Solana runtime provides a service to estimate the cost of a transaction based on the proposed fee schedule. The main function in this file is `calculate_cost`, which returns a `TransactionCost` struct containing the cost details of a transaction.

The `TransactionCost` struct contains the following fields:
- `writable_accounts`: A vector of public keys representing the writable accounts involved in the transaction.
- `signature_cost`: The cost of verifying the signatures in the transaction.
- `write_lock_cost`: The cost of locking the writable accounts for the transaction.
- `data_bytes_cost`: The cost of processing the data bytes in the transaction.
- `builtins_execution_cost`: The cost of executing built-in instructions in the transaction.
- `bpf_execution_cost`: The cost of executing BPF instructions in the transaction.
- `account_data_size`: The total size of the account data involved in the transaction.
- `is_simple_vote`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction is a simple vote transaction.

The `CostModel` struct provides the following methods to calculate the cost of a transaction:
- `calculate_cost`: The main function that calculates the total cost of a transaction.
- `get_signature_cost`: Calculates the cost of verifying the signatures in the transaction.
- `get_write_lock_cost`: Calculates the cost of locking the writable accounts for the transaction.
- `get_transaction_cost`: Calculates the cost of executing the instructions in the transaction.
- `calculate_account_data_size`: Calculates the total size of the account data involved in the transaction.

Here's an example of how the `calculate_cost` function can be used:

```rust
let tx_cost = CostModel::calculate_cost(&transaction, &feature_set);
println!("The total cost of the transaction is: {}", tx_cost.sum());
```

In this example, `transaction` is a `SanitizedTransaction` object and `feature_set` is a `FeatureSet` object. The `calculate_cost` function returns a `TransactionCost` object, and the `sum` method is called on it to get the total cost of the transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TransactionCost` struct and its fields?
   **Answer**: The `TransactionCost` struct is used to store the cost of a transaction in terms of compute units. It has fields for different types of costs, such as signature cost, write lock cost, data bytes cost, built-in execution cost, and BPF execution cost. It also stores the writable accounts involved in the transaction, the total account data size, and a flag to indicate if the transaction is a simple vote.

2. **Question**: How is the total cost of a transaction calculated in the `TransactionCost` struct?
   **Answer**: The total cost of a transaction is calculated using the `sum` method of the `TransactionCost` struct. It adds up the costs of all the fields (signature cost, write lock cost, data bytes cost, built-in execution cost, and BPF execution cost) using saturating addition to prevent overflow.

3. **Question**: How does the `CostModel::calculate_cost` function work, and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `CostModel::calculate_cost` function takes a sanitized transaction and a feature set as input and calculates the cost of the transaction. It initializes a `TransactionCost` struct, calculates the signature cost, write lock cost, and transaction cost (including built-in and BPF execution costs), and sets the account data size and simple vote flag. The function returns the populated `TransactionCost` struct.
