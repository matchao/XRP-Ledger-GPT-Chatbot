The `snapshot_archive_info.rs` file contains code that provides information about snapshot archives. The file defines two structs, `SnapshotArchiveInfo` and `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo`, and a trait `SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter`. The `SnapshotArchiveInfo` struct contains information about a snapshot archive, including its path, slot, hash, and archive format. The `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct is a wrapper around `SnapshotArchiveInfo` and provides additional functionality to parse the path to a full snapshot archive and return a new `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo`. The `SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter` trait defines methods to query the snapshot archive information, including `path()`, `slot()`, `hash()`, `archive_format()`, and `is_remote()`. 

The `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct is similar to `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` but contains additional information about an incremental snapshot archive, including its base slot. The `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` struct also implements the `SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter` trait. 

The code also defines `PartialOrd` and `Ord` traits for `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` and `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` to enable sorting of snapshot archives by slot and base slot, respectively. 

This code is used in the Solana project to manage snapshot archives. Snapshot archives are used to store a copy of the blockchain state at a particular point in time. The `SnapshotArchiveInfo` struct contains information about a snapshot archive, and the `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` and `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` structs provide additional functionality to parse the path to a snapshot archive and return a new struct with the relevant information. The `SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter` trait provides methods to query the snapshot archive information, which can be used by other parts of the Solana project to access snapshot archives. The `PartialOrd` and `Ord` traits enable sorting of snapshot archives by slot and base slot, respectively, which can be useful for certain operations such as restoring the blockchain state from a snapshot archive. 

Example usage:

```rust
use solana_runtime::snapshot_archive_info::{FullSnapshotArchiveInfo, SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter};
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    let path = PathBuf::from("/path/to/full_snapshot_archive");
    let full_snapshot_archive_info = FullSnapshotArchiveInfo::new_from_path(path).unwrap();

    println!("Snapshot archive path: {:?}", full_snapshot_archive_info.path());
    println!("Snapshot archive slot: {}", full_snapshot_archive_info.slot());
    println!("Snapshot archive hash: {:?}", full_snapshot_archive_info.hash());
    println!("Snapshot archive format: {:?}", full_snapshot_archive_info.archive_format());
    println!("Is snapshot archive remote: {}", full_snapshot_archive_info.is_remote());
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter` trait?
- The `SnapshotArchiveInfoGetter` trait is used to query information about a snapshot archive, such as its path, slot, hash, and archive format.

2. What is the difference between `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` and `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo`?
- `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` contains information about a full snapshot archive, while `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` contains information about an incremental snapshot archive, including the base slot that the incremental snapshot was based from.

3. How are `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` and `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` ordered?
- `FullSnapshotArchiveInfo` is ordered by slot in ascending order, while `IncrementalSnapshotArchiveInfo` is ordered first by base slot in ascending order, then by slot in ascending order. This effectively sorts the snapshot archives chronologically.
