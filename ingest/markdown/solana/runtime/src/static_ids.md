The code in `static_ids.rs` defines a vector of static token and mint IDs for the Solana blockchain. These IDs are used to identify specific tokens and mints within the Solana ecosystem. The `lazy_static` macro is used to create a lazily evaluated static variable called `STATIC_IDS`, which is a vector of `Pubkey` objects.

The `STATIC_IDS` vector contains the following IDs:
- `inline_spl_associated_token_account::id()`: This is the ID of the associated token account program, which is used to create and manage associated token accounts for users.
- `inline_spl_associated_token_account::program_v1_1_0::id()`: This is the ID of a specific version (v1.1.0) of the associated token account program.
- `inline_spl_token::id()`: This is the ID of the SPL token program, which is used to create and manage token accounts and transfers.
- `inline_spl_token::native_mint::id()`: This is the ID of the native SOL token mint, which is used to mint new SOL tokens.
- `inline_spl_token_2022::id()`: This is the ID of a newer version (2022) of the SPL token program.

These IDs are used throughout the Solana codebase to identify specific tokens and mints. For example, the `inline_spl_token` module uses the `id()` method to retrieve the ID of the SPL token program, which is then used to create and manage token accounts and transfers.

Developers working on Solana projects can use these static IDs to ensure consistency and compatibility across different applications and versions. For example, if a developer wants to create a new token account for a user, they can use the `inline_spl_associated_token_account` program and its associated ID to ensure that the account is created correctly and can be used with other Solana applications.

Overall, the `static_ids.rs` file plays an important role in defining and organizing the various IDs used within the Solana ecosystem, and helps ensure consistency and compatibility across different applications and versions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    - This code defines a vector of static token and mint IDs for the Solana blockchain.

2. What is the significance of the `lazy_static!` macro?
    - The `lazy_static!` macro is used to create a static variable that is lazily initialized on its first use, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary initialization.

3. What are the different types of IDs included in the `STATIC_IDS` vector?
    - The `STATIC_IDS` vector includes IDs for associated token accounts, token programs, native tokens, and a specific version of the SPL token program.
