The `TransactionPriorityDetails` struct and `GetTransactionPriorityDetails` trait are defined in this file. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to extract transaction priority details from a sanitized transaction. 

The `TransactionPriorityDetails` struct contains two fields: `priority` and `compute_unit_limit`. `priority` is a `u64` value that represents the priority of the transaction, and `compute_unit_limit` is a `u64` value that represents the maximum number of compute units that can be used by the transaction. 

The `GetTransactionPriorityDetails` trait defines two methods: `get_transaction_priority_details` and `process_compute_budget_instruction`. The former is a method that returns an `Option<TransactionPriorityDetails>` and is implemented for both `SanitizedVersionedTransaction` and `SanitizedTransaction`. The latter is a method that takes an iterator of `(Pubkey, CompiledInstruction)` pairs and returns an `Option<TransactionPriorityDetails>`. 

The `process_compute_budget_instruction` method creates a `ComputeBudget` object with default values and processes the given instructions using the `process_instructions` method. The `process_instructions` method takes several boolean arguments that determine which instructions are supported and how they are processed. If the instructions are processed successfully, the method returns a `PrioritizationFeeDetails` object, which contains the priority of the transaction and the number of compute units used. The method then returns an `Option<TransactionPriorityDetails>` object with the priority and compute unit limit values extracted from the `PrioritizationFeeDetails` object and the `ComputeBudget` object, respectively. 

The `get_transaction_priority_details` method calls the `process_compute_budget_instruction` method with the program instructions iterator of the sanitized transaction and returns the result. 

The `tests` module contains several unit tests that create different types of transactions and assert that the `get_transaction_priority_details` method returns the expected `TransactionPriorityDetails` object. 

Overall, this code provides a way to extract transaction priority details from a sanitized transaction, which can be useful for prioritizing transactions in a transaction pool or for other purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionPriorityDetails` struct?
- The `TransactionPriorityDetails` struct holds information about the priority and compute unit limit of a transaction.

2. What is the `GetTransactionPriorityDetails` trait used for?
- The `GetTransactionPriorityDetails` trait defines a method to get the transaction priority details and a method to process compute budget instructions.

3. What are the tests in the `tests` module testing?
- The tests in the `tests` module are testing the `get_transaction_priority_details` method for different types of transactions with different compute budget instructions, and asserting that the expected `TransactionPriorityDetails` are returned.
