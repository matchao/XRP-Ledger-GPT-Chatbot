The `compare.rs` file in the `solana/runtime/src/snapshot_package` module provides functions to compare and prioritize different types of snapshot and accounts packages. These functions are used to determine the order in which packages should be processed in the larger Solana project.

The main functions provided are:

1. `cmp_snapshot_packages_by_priority(a: &SnapshotPackage, b: &SnapshotPackage) -> Ordering`: This function compares two snapshot packages by their priority, first by their type (Full or Incremental), and then by their slot. Full snapshots have higher priority than incremental snapshots.

2. `cmp_accounts_packages_by_priority(a: &AccountsPackage, b: &AccountsPackage) -> Ordering`: This function compares two accounts packages by their priority, first by their type (Epoch Accounts Hash, Full Snapshot, Incremental Snapshot, or Accounts Hash Verifier), and then by their slot. The priority order is as follows: Epoch Accounts Hash > Full Snapshot > Incremental Snapshot > Accounts Hash Verifier.

3. `cmp_accounts_package_types_by_priority(a: &AccountsPackageType, b: &AccountsPackageType) -> Ordering`: This function compares two accounts package types by their priority, as described above.

4. `cmp_snapshot_types_by_priority(a: &SnapshotType, b: &SnapshotType) -> Ordering`: This function compares two snapshot types by their priority. Full snapshots have higher priority than incremental snapshots. If two incremental snapshots are compared, their base slots are used as the tiebreaker.

Example usage:

```rust
let snapshot_package_a = new(SnapshotType::FullSnapshot, 11);
let snapshot_package_b = new(SnapshotType::FullSnapshot, 22);
let result = cmp_snapshot_packages_by_priority(&snapshot_package_a, &snapshot_package_b);
assert_eq!(result, Less);
```

In this example, `snapshot_package_a` has a lower priority than `snapshot_package_b` because it has a lower slot value (11 < 22).
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `cmp_snapshot_packages_by_priority` function?
   **Answer**: The `cmp_snapshot_packages_by_priority` function is used to compare two `SnapshotPackage` instances by their priority, first by their snapshot type and then by their slot.

2. **Question**: How does the `cmp_accounts_package_types_by_priority` function determine the priority of different `AccountsPackageType` instances?
   **Answer**: The `cmp_accounts_package_types_by_priority` function determines the priority of `AccountsPackageType` instances based on a predefined order: Epoch Accounts Hash has the highest priority, followed by Full Snapshot, Incremental Snapshot, and finally Accounts Hash Verifier. If two `Snapshot`s are compared, their snapshot types are used as the tiebreaker.

3. **Question**: How are the priorities of `SnapshotType` instances compared in the `cmp_snapshot_types_by_priority` function?
   **Answer**: The `cmp_snapshot_types_by_priority` function compares the priorities of `SnapshotType` instances by considering Full Snapshots to be of higher priority than Incremental Snapshots. If two `IncrementalSnapshot`s are compared, their base slots are used as the tiebreaker.
