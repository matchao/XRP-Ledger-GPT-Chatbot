The `RootBankCache` struct is a wrapper around a root `Bank` that only loads from bank forks if the root has been updated. This can be useful to avoid read-locking the bank forks until the root has been updated. The purpose of this code is to provide a cached root bank that can be used to avoid read-locking the bank forks until the root has been updated. 

The `RootBankCache` struct has four fields: `bank_forks`, `cached_root_bank`, `root_slot`, and `root_bank`. The `bank_forks` field is an `Arc<RwLock<BankForks>>` that holds the bank forks. The `cached_root_bank` field is an `Arc<Bank>` that holds the cached root bank. The `root_slot` field is a `ReadOnlyAtomicSlot` that holds the root slot. The `root_bank` field is an `Arc<Bank>` that holds the root bank.

The `new` function creates a new `RootBankCache` instance. It takes an `Arc<RwLock<BankForks>>` as an argument and returns a `RootBankCache` instance. The `cached_root_bank` and `root_slot` fields are initialized with the root bank and the atomic root slot, respectively.

The `root_bank` function returns the root bank. It first checks if the cached root bank's slot is equal to the current root slot. If they are not equal, it reads the bank forks and updates the cached root bank. Finally, it returns the cached root bank.

The `tests` module contains a test for the `RootBankCache` struct. It creates a new `RootBankCache` instance and checks that the root bank is equal to the cached root bank. It then creates a child bank and inserts it into the bank forks. It checks that the cached slot is still 0 since the root has not been set. It then sets the root to 1 and checks that the root bank has been updated and is equal to the cached root bank. 

Overall, the `RootBankCache` struct provides a cached root bank that can be used to avoid read-locking the bank forks until the root has been updated. This can be useful in situations where multiple threads need to access the root bank and the bank forks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RootBankCache` struct?
    
    The `RootBankCache` struct is a wrapper around a root `Bank` that only loads from bank forks if the root has been updated. This can be useful to avoid read-locking the bank forks until the root has been updated.

2. How does the `RootBankCache` determine if the root has been updated?
    
    The `RootBankCache` determines if the root has been updated by comparing the current root slot with the slot of the cached root bank. If they are not equal, the `RootBankCache` loads the root bank from the bank forks.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_root_bank_cache` function in the `tests` module?
    
    The `test_root_bank_cache` function tests the functionality of the `RootBankCache` struct by creating a new `Bank`, inserting a child bank, and setting the root. It asserts that the `RootBankCache` correctly loads the root bank from the bank forks and updates the cached root bank when necessary.
