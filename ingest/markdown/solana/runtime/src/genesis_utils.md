The `genesis_utils.rs` file in the Solana runtime module provides utility functions for creating and configuring the genesis block of a Solana cluster. The genesis block is the first block in the blockchain and contains the initial state of the system, including the initial accounts and their balances, as well as the configuration parameters for the cluster.

The `ValidatorVoteKeypairs` struct holds the keypairs for a validator node, its associated vote account, and its stake account. The `GenesisConfigInfo` struct contains the genesis configuration, the mint keypair, the voting keypair, and the validator's public key.

The `create_genesis_config` function creates a `GenesisConfigInfo` with a specified number of mint lamports. The `create_genesis_config_with_leader` function creates a `GenesisConfigInfo` with a specified validator pubkey and stake lamports. The `create_genesis_config_with_vote_accounts` and `create_genesis_config_with_vote_accounts_and_cluster_type` functions create a `GenesisConfigInfo` with multiple vote accounts and their corresponding stakes, as well as an optional cluster type.

The `activate_all_features` function activates all features at genesis in development mode, while the `activate_feature` function activates a specific feature by its feature ID.

The `create_genesis_config_with_leader_ex` function creates a `GenesisConfig` with a specified mint pubkey, validator pubkey, vote account pubkey, stake account pubkey, stake lamports, validator lamports, fee rate governor, rent, cluster type, and a list of initial accounts. This function sets up the initial accounts and their balances, as well as the configuration parameters for the cluster.

These utility functions are used in the larger Solana project to set up and configure the initial state of a Solana cluster, which is essential for the proper functioning of the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `VALIDATOR_LAMPORTS` constant and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `VALIDATOR_LAMPORTS` constant is the default amount of lamports received by the validator. It is used to initialize the account balance for validator nodes in the genesis configuration.

2. **Question**: How does the `create_genesis_config_with_vote_accounts_and_cluster_type` function work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `create_genesis_config_with_vote_accounts_and_cluster_type` function creates a genesis configuration with the specified vote accounts, stakes, and cluster type. It takes in the mint lamports, an array of voting keypairs, a vector of stakes, and a cluster type as inputs. It returns a `GenesisConfigInfo` struct containing the generated genesis configuration, mint keypair, voting keypair, and validator pubkey.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `activate_all_features` function and when is it called?
   **Answer**: The `activate_all_features` function is used to activate all features at genesis in development mode. It is called within the `create_genesis_config_with_leader_ex` function when the cluster type is set to `ClusterType::Development`.
