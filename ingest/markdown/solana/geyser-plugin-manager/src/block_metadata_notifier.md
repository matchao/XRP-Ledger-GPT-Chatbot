The `BlockMetadataNotifierImpl` struct and its implementation provide a way to notify plugins about block metadata updates. It implements the `BlockMetadataNotifier` trait, which defines a single method `notify_block_metadata`. This method takes in various block metadata information such as the parent slot, parent blockhash, slot, blockhash, rewards, block time, block height, and executed transaction count. It then builds a `ReplicaBlockInfoV2` struct using this information and passes it to each plugin's `notify_block_metadata` method. If there are no plugins registered, the method returns early.

The `BlockMetadataNotifierImpl` struct has a single field `plugin_manager` of type `Arc<RwLock<GeyserPluginManager>>`. This field is used to access the list of plugins that have been registered with the `GeyserPluginManager`.

The `build_rewards` method takes in a `RwLock<Vec<(Pubkey, RewardInfo)>>` and returns a `Rewards` struct. It reads the rewards vector and maps each `(Pubkey, RewardInfo)` tuple to a `Reward` struct. The `Reward` struct is a simplified version of the `solana_transaction_status::Reward` struct that only contains the fields needed for block metadata. The resulting `Vec<Reward>` is then collected into a `Rewards` struct.

The `build_replica_block_info` method takes in various block metadata information and returns a `ReplicaBlockInfoV2` struct. This struct contains the same information as the method's arguments and is used to notify plugins about block metadata updates.

The `new` method is a simple constructor that takes in a `plugin_manager` and returns a new `BlockMetadataNotifierImpl` instance.

Overall, this code provides a way for plugins to be notified about block metadata updates. This can be useful for plugins that need to perform certain actions based on block metadata, such as updating external databases or triggering other events. The `BlockMetadataNotifierImpl` struct acts as a mediator between the `GeyserPluginManager` and the plugins, allowing plugins to be notified without having to directly interact with the manager.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a struct `BlockMetadataNotifierImpl` that implements the `BlockMetadataNotifier` trait and provides a method to notify block metadata to plugins managed by a `GeyserPluginManager`.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external crates including `solana_geyser_plugin_interface`, `solana_measure`, `solana_metrics`, `solana_runtime`, and `solana_sdk`.

3. What data is included in the block metadata that is being notified to the plugins?
- The block metadata includes information such as the parent slot and blockhash, current slot and blockhash, rewards, block time, block height, and executed transaction count. This information is used to build a `ReplicaBlockInfoV2` struct that is passed to the plugins.
