The `tpu_info.rs` file contains code related to the TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) information in the Solana project. The purpose of this code is to define a trait `TpuInfo` and a struct `NullTpuInfo` that implements this trait. The `TpuInfo` trait defines two methods: `refresh_recent_peers` and `get_leader_tpus`. The `refresh_recent_peers` method is used to refresh the list of recent peers, while the `get_leader_tpus` method returns a vector of socket addresses for the leader TPUs (Transaction Processing Units).

The `NullTpuInfo` struct is a dummy implementation of the `TpuInfo` trait. It does not do anything in the `refresh_recent_peers` method and returns an empty vector in the `get_leader_tpus` method. This implementation is useful for testing or for cases where the TPU information is not available.

The `TpuInfo` trait and the `NullTpuInfo` struct can be used in other parts of the Solana project where TPU information is required. For example, in the `send_transaction_service` module, the `TpuInfo` trait is used to define the `TpuInfoProvider` trait, which is implemented by the `TpuInfoService` struct. The `TpuInfoService` struct provides the TPU information to the `send_transaction_service` module, which is responsible for sending transactions to the Solana network.

Here is an example of how the `get_leader_tpus` method can be used:

```rust
use solana_send_transaction_service::tpu_info::{TpuInfo, NullTpuInfo};

fn main() {
    let tpu_info = NullTpuInfo {};
    let leader_tpus = tpu_info.get_leader_tpus(10);
    println!("Leader TPUs: {:?}", leader_tpus);
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `NullTpuInfo` struct and call the `get_leader_tpus` method with a maximum count of 10. The method returns an empty vector, which is printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `TpuInfo` trait?**
The `TpuInfo` trait defines methods for refreshing recent peers and getting leader TPUs. It is likely used to manage communication with TPUs (Transaction Processing Units) in the Solana network.

2. **What is the `NullTpuInfo` struct used for?**
The `NullTpuInfo` struct implements the `TpuInfo` trait, but its methods do nothing and return empty values. It may be used as a placeholder or default value when actual TPU information is not available.

3. **What does the `get_leader_tpus` method return?**
The `get_leader_tpus` method returns a vector of references to `SocketAddr` objects representing the addresses of leader TPUs. The maximum number of addresses returned is determined by the `max_count` parameter.
