The `aligned_memory.rs` file provides a data structure called `AlignedMemory` that manages memory allocation with a specified alignment. This is useful in scenarios where memory alignment is crucial for performance or hardware requirements. The `AlignedMemory` struct has a generic parameter `ALIGN` that determines the alignment of the memory.

The `AlignedMemory` struct provides several methods for creating instances with different memory allocation strategies:

- `from_slice(data: &[u8])`: Creates an `AlignedMemory` instance by copying the given slice.
- `with_capacity(max_len: usize)`: Creates an empty `AlignedMemory` instance with uninitialized preallocated memory.
- `with_capacity_zeroed(max_len: usize)`: Creates an empty `AlignedMemory` instance with zero-initialized preallocated memory.
- `zero_filled(max_len: usize)`: Creates a filled `AlignedMemory` instance with zero-initialized preallocated memory.

The struct also provides methods for working with the allocated memory:

- `as_slice(&self) -> &[u8]`: Returns an aligned slice of the memory.
- `as_slice_mut(&mut self) -> &mut [u8]`: Returns an aligned mutable slice of the memory.
- `fill_write(&mut self, num: usize, value: u8) -> std::io::Result<()>`: Grows memory with `value` repeated `num` times starting at the `write_index`.
- `write_unchecked<T: Pod>(&mut self, value: T)`: Writes a generic type `T` into the memory, assuming there is enough capacity.
- `write_all_unchecked(&mut self, value: &[u8])`: Writes a slice of bytes into the memory, assuming there is enough capacity.

Example usage:

```rust
// Create an AlignedMemory instance with a capacity of 10 bytes and an alignment of 8 bytes
let mut aligned_memory = AlignedMemory::<8>::with_capacity(10);

// Write a byte to the memory
aligned_memory.write(&[42u8; 1]).unwrap();

// Get the aligned slice of the memory
let slice = aligned_memory.as_slice();
```

The `AlignedMemory` struct also implements the `std::io::Write` trait, allowing it to be used with functions that expect a `Write` implementation.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Pod` trait and why are there multiple implementations for different types?
   **Answer:** The `Pod` trait represents scalar types, also known as "plain old data". It is implemented for different primitive types to allow the `AlignedMemory` struct to work with these types when writing data into the memory.

2. **Question:** How does the `AlignedMemory` struct ensure that the memory is aligned with the specified alignment?
   **Answer:** The `AlignedMemory` struct uses the `align_offset` field to store the offset required for the desired alignment. The `get_mem` and `get_mem_zeroed` functions calculate this offset using the `align_offset` method on the memory pointer, and the memory is then resized accordingly.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `write_unchecked` and `write_all_unchecked` methods, and why are they marked as unsafe?
   **Answer:** The `write_unchecked` and `write_all_unchecked` methods are used to write a generic type `T` or a slice of bytes into the memory, respectively. They are marked as unsafe because they assume that there is enough capacity in the memory to accommodate the data being written, and it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure this condition is met.
