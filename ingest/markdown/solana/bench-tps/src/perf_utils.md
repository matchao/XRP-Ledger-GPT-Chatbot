The `perf_utils.rs` file contains a Rust module that provides utilities for benchmarking the performance of the Solana blockchain network. The module exports a function called `sample_txs` that samples the transactions per second (TPS) of a Solana node and records the results in a shared data structure.

The `sample_txs` function takes four arguments: an atomic boolean signal to indicate when to stop sampling, a shared read-write lock to store the sample statistics, a sampling period in seconds, and a client object that implements the `BenchTpsClient` trait. The `BenchTpsClient` trait defines a set of methods for interacting with a Solana node to perform benchmarking tasks.

The `sample_txs` function uses a loop to repeatedly sample the TPS of the Solana node until the exit signal is set. Inside the loop, the function first gets the current transaction count of the node using the `get_transaction_count_with_commitment` method of the client object. If the method returns an error, the function logs a message and sleeps for the sampling period before continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

If the transaction count is valid, the function calculates the TPS of the node by dividing the number of transactions processed during the sampling period by the duration of the period. The function also keeps track of the maximum TPS seen so far and the total number of transactions processed by the node.

The function logs the TPS, the number of transactions processed during the sampling period, the total number of transactions processed by the node, and the elapsed time since the start of the sampling. The function then checks if the exit signal is set and, if so, records the sample statistics in the shared data structure and returns.

The `SampleStats` struct defines a data structure to store the sample statistics. The struct has three fields: `tps` for the maximum TPS seen, `elapsed` for the total time taken for the transactions, and `txs` for the total number of transactions processed.

This module is used in the Solana project to benchmark the performance of the Solana blockchain network. Developers can use the `sample_txs` function to measure the TPS of a Solana node and compare it with other nodes or previous measurements. The shared data structure can be used to aggregate the sample statistics from multiple nodes and generate reports or visualizations of the network performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SampleStats` struct?
- The `SampleStats` struct is used to store statistics related to the performance of a node, including the maximum TPS reported, the total time taken for transactions, and the total number of transactions reported.

2. What is the purpose of the `sample_txs` function?
- The `sample_txs` function is used to sample the number of transactions processed by a node over a given period of time, and calculate the TPS (transactions per second) rate. It also updates the `SampleStats` struct with the maximum TPS, total time taken, and total number of transactions.

3. What is the purpose of the `exit_signal` parameter in the `sample_txs` function?
- The `exit_signal` parameter is used to signal when the sampling should stop. When the signal is received, the function updates the `SampleStats` struct with the final statistics and returns.
