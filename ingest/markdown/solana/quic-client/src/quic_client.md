The `quic_client.rs` file contains code for a simple client that connects to a given UDP port with the QUIC protocol and provides an interface for sending data which is restricted by the server's flow control. The purpose of this code is to provide a way for clients to communicate with a server using the QUIC protocol and to handle flow control restrictions imposed by the server.

The code defines a `QuicClientConnection` struct that implements the `ClientConnection` trait. The `QuicClientConnection` struct has methods for sending data synchronously and asynchronously, as well as for sending data in batches. The `QuicClientConnection` struct uses an `Arc<NonblockingQuicConnection>` to manage the connection to the server.

The code also defines an `AsyncTaskSemaphore` struct that is used for limiting the number of asynchronous tasks spawned to the runtime. The `ASYNC_TASK_SEMAPHORE` lazy static variable is an instance of this struct with a maximum usage of `MAX_OUTSTANDING_TASK` tasks.

The `RUNTIME` lazy static variable is an instance of the `tokio::runtime::Runtime` struct that is used to spawn asynchronous tasks.

The `send_data_async` and `send_data_batch_async` functions are used to send data asynchronously to the server. These functions use the `ASYNC_TASK_SEMAPHORE` to limit the number of asynchronous tasks spawned to the runtime. The `send_data_async` function sends a single buffer of data to the server, while the `send_data_batch_async` function sends a batch of buffers to the server.

The `handle_send_result` function is used to check the result of sending data asynchronously to the server and update stats if timed out.

Overall, this code provides a simple client for communicating with a server using the QUIC protocol and handles flow control restrictions imposed by the server. The `QuicClientConnection` struct provides a simple interface for sending data synchronously and asynchronously, as well as for sending data in batches. The `AsyncTaskSemaphore` struct and `RUNTIME` lazy static variable are used to manage asynchronous tasks and limit their usage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ASYNC_TASK_SEMAPHORE` and how is it used in this code?
   - The `ASYNC_TASK_SEMAPHORE` is a semaphore used to limit the number of asynchronous tasks spawned to the runtime. It is used to acquire and release a lock on the counter to ensure that the maximum usage allowed by the semaphore is not exceeded.
2. What is the difference between `send_data_async` and `send_data_batch_async`?
   - `send_data_async` sends a single buffer of data asynchronously, while `send_data_batch_async` sends multiple buffers of data asynchronously. `send_data_batch_async` also has a longer timeout based on the number of buffers being sent.
3. What is the purpose of the `QuicClientConnection` struct and how is it used in this code?
   - The `QuicClientConnection` struct is used to create a new connection to a server using the QUIC protocol. It provides methods for sending data synchronously and asynchronously, and is implemented as a wrapper around `NonblockingQuicConnection`.
