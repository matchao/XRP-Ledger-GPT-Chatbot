The code in `lib.rs` is responsible for limiting the number of threads used by the Rayon thread pool in the Solana project. Rayon is a parallel computing library that allows for easy parallelization of code by abstracting away the details of thread creation and management. However, if not properly configured, Rayon can use too many threads and hog CPU resources, leading to poor performance.

To address this issue, the code in `lib.rs` uses the `lazy_static` macro to define a global static variable called `MAX_RAYON_THREADS`. This variable is initialized using the `env::var` function to read the value of an environment variable called `SOLANA_RAYON_THREADS`. If this environment variable is not set, the code uses the `num_cpus::get()` function to determine the number of CPU cores available and sets `MAX_RAYON_THREADS` to half that value. The `max` function is then used to ensure that `MAX_RAYON_THREADS` is at least 1.

The `get_thread_count` function simply returns the value of `MAX_RAYON_THREADS`, while the `get_max_thread_count` function returns twice the value of `MAX_RAYON_THREADS`. The latter function is marked as only used in legacy code and recommends using `get_thread_count` instead in all new code.

Overall, this code ensures that the Rayon thread pool in Solana uses a reasonable number of threads that won't hog CPU resources. It can be used in the larger project by calling `get_thread_count` to determine the maximum number of threads that should be used for parallel computations. For example:

```
use solana_rayon_threadlimit::get_thread_count;

let num_threads = get_thread_count();
rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(num_threads).build_global().unwrap();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `lazy_static` macro in this code?
   - The `lazy_static` macro is used to create a static variable that is lazily initialized at runtime, and can be accessed across multiple threads.

2. Why is the number of threads each pool is allowed to half the cpu core count?
   - The number of threads each pool is allowed to half the cpu core count to avoid Rayon from hogging CPU.

3. What is the difference between `get_thread_count` and `get_max_thread_count` functions?
   - `get_thread_count` returns the maximum number of threads that Rayon is allowed to use, while `get_max_thread_count` returns twice the value of `get_thread_count` and is only used in legacy code.
