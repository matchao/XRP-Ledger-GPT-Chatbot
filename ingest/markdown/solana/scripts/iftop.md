The `iftop.sh` script is a bash script that reports network bandwidth usage. It is designed to be run on a Linux system and will exit if it is run on any other operating system. 

The purpose of this script is to provide a quick and easy way to monitor network bandwidth usage on a Linux system. It does this by using the `iftop` command, which is a command-line tool that displays bandwidth usage on an interface. The script uses `ifconfig` to get a list of network interfaces, filters out the loopback interface, and selects the first running interface with the highest MTU (maximum transmission unit) value. It then passes this interface to the `iftop` command along with several options that control the output format and refresh rate. 

The script also includes a check to see if it is being run with root privileges. If it is not, it will attempt to run the `iftop` command with `sudo`. If `sudo` is not available or the user does not have permission to run it, the script will fail. 

This script can be used in a larger project as a way to monitor network bandwidth usage in real-time. It could be incorporated into a monitoring system or used as a standalone tool for troubleshooting network issues. 

Example usage:

```
$ ./iftop.sh
```

This will run the script and display the network bandwidth usage on the selected interface. The output will be updated every second and will show the total bandwidth usage as well as the usage for each individual connection. The script will continue to run until it is interrupted with `Ctrl-C`.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this script do?
   This script reports network bandwidth usage.

2. Why is `sudo` being used in this script?
   `sudo` is being used to run the `iftop` command with elevated privileges.

3. What does the `iftop` command do and what are the options being used?
   The `iftop` command displays bandwidth usage on an interface in real-time. The options being used are `-i` to specify the interface, `-nNbBP` to disable hostname resolution and port display, `-t` to show traffic in real-time, and `-L 1000` to limit the number of packets displayed to 1000.
