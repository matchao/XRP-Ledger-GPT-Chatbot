The `perf-stats.py` script is a performance analysis tool for the Solana blockchain project. It takes an input file as an argument and parses it to extract performance data. The script then calculates various statistics and outputs them to the console.

The input file is expected to contain lines of text, each of which represents a performance measurement. The script reads each line and extracts a JSON object from it. The JSON object contains information about the performance measurement, including the name of the counter, the timestamp, and the count.

The script aggregates the performance data by counter name. For each counter, it calculates various statistics, including the maximum and minimum speeds, the count, the mean, the average, and the 80th percentile. It also outputs the top 5 speeds that are above the average.

The script outputs the statistics for each counter to the console in a formatted manner. The output includes the counter name, the maximum and minimum speeds, the count, the total count, the mean, the average, and the 80th percentile. It also outputs the top 5 speeds that are above the average and the timestamps for the maximum and minimum speeds.

This script is useful for analyzing the performance of the Solana blockchain. It can be used to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. It can also be used to compare the performance of different versions of the Solana software. For example, if the performance of a particular counter has decreased in a new version of the software, the script can be used to identify the cause of the decrease and to measure the effectiveness of any optimizations that are made. 

Example usage:

```
$ python3 perf-stats.py perf.log
stage: stage1 max: 1,000.00 min: 100.00 count: 10 total: 100 mean: 500.00 average: 550.00 80%: 800.00
    top 5: 1,000.00  900.00  800.00  
    max_ts: 1234567890 min_ts: 1234567880

stage: stage2 max: 2,000.00 min: 200.00 count: 20 total: 200 mean: 1,000.00 average: 1,100.00 80%: 1,600.00
    top 5: 2,000.00  1,800.00  1,600.00  
    max_ts: 1234567900 min_ts: 1234567870

...
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script is used to parse an input file and generate performance statistics for different stages of a program.

2. What is the format of the input file expected by this script?
    
    The script expects the input file to contain lines with JSON data that include a "COUNTER" field.

3. What performance statistics are generated by this script?
    
    The script generates statistics such as maximum speed, minimum speed, count, total, mean, average, and 80% for each stage of the program. It also outputs the top 5 speeds and the timestamps for the maximum and minimum speeds.
