The `increment-cargo-version.sh` script is used to increment the version number of the `Cargo.toml` file in the Solana project. The script takes an argument that specifies whether to increment the major, minor, or patch version number. If no argument is provided, the script will remove the prerelease tag if present, otherwise, it will increment the minor version number. The script also has a `check` subcommand that checks if the version number is correctly specified in all the `Cargo.toml` files in the project.

The script starts by defining a function `usage()` that prints out the usage instructions for the script. It then sets the `here` variable to the directory containing the script and changes the current directory to the parent directory. The script then sources two other scripts: `semver.sh` and `read-cargo-variable.sh`. `semver.sh` is a bash script that provides functions for parsing and comparing semantic version numbers. `read-cargo-variable.sh` is a script that reads a variable from a `Cargo.toml` file.

The script then defines an array `ignores` that contains a list of directories to ignore when searching for `Cargo.toml` files. It then constructs an array `not_paths` that contains the negated paths of the directories in `ignores`. The script then uses the `find` command to find all the `Cargo.toml` files in the project directory and its subdirectories, excluding the directories in `ignores`. The `find` command returns an array of file paths that match the search criteria.

The script then loops through the array of `Cargo.toml` file paths and reads the `name` variable from each file using the `readCargoVariable` function from `read-cargo-variable.sh`. The `name` variable is the name of the crate specified in the `Cargo.toml` file. The script collects all the crate names in an array `crates`.

The script then reads the current version number from the `Cargo.toml` file using the `readCargoVariable` function. It then parses the version number using the `semverParseInto` function from `semver.sh`. The major, minor, and patch version numbers are stored in variables `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, and `PATCH`, respectively. The prerelease tag is stored in the `SPECIAL` variable. If the major version number is not set, the script prints the usage instructions and exits.

The script then checks the argument passed to the script. If no argument is passed, it sets the `bump` variable to `dropspecial` if the prerelease tag is present, otherwise, it sets it to `minor`. If an argument is passed, the script sets the `bump` variable to the argument. The script then sets the `SPECIAL` variable to an empty string.

The script then uses a `case` statement to determine what to increment based on the value of `bump`. If `bump` is `patch`, it increments the patch version number. If `bump` is `major`, it increments the major version number and sets the minor and patch version numbers to 0. If `bump` is `minor`, it increments the minor version number and sets the patch version number to 0. If `bump` is `dropspecial`, it removes the prerelease tag. If `bump` is `check`, it checks if the version number is correctly specified in all the `Cargo.toml` files in the project. If `bump` starts with a `-`, it sets the `SPECIAL` variable to the argument. If `bump` is anything else, it prints the usage instructions and exits.

The script then checks if the working tree is dirty and exits if it is. It then sets the `newVersion` variable to the new version number based on the values of `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`, and `SPECIAL`. The script then loops through the array of `Cargo.toml` file paths and updates the version number in each file. It also updates the version references to other internal crates. Finally, the script updates the cargo lock files and prints the old and new version numbers.

The `increment-cargo-version.sh` script is used to automate the process of incrementing the version number of the `Cargo.toml` file in the Solana project. It saves time and reduces the risk of human error. The script can be used by developers working on the Solana project to increment the version number before releasing a new version of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this script do?
- This script increments the version number in the `Cargo.toml` file of a Rust project.

2. What is the purpose of the `semver_bash` and `read-cargo-variable.sh` scripts?
- The `semver_bash` script is used to parse the current version number from the `Cargo.toml` file, while the `read-cargo-variable.sh` script is used to read the name of all the internal crates in the project.

3. What is the purpose of the `check` subcommand?
- The `check` subcommand checks that the version number specified in each `Cargo.toml` file matches the current version number. If there is a mismatch, it outputs an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.
