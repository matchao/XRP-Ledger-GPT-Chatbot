The `confirm-cargo-version-numbers-before-bump.sh` script is used to check that the tag matches the branch (unless the branch is `master`) and that the `Cargo.toml` versions match the tag. This script is used to ensure that the version numbers in the `Cargo.toml` files are consistent with the tag being created. 

The script takes two arguments, `branch` and `tag`, and checks that the `tag` matches the `branch` (unless the `branch` is `master`) and that the `Cargo.toml` versions match the `tag`. If the `tag` does not match the `branch` or the `Cargo.toml` versions do not match the `tag`, an error message is printed to the console and the script exits with an error code.

The script first checks that the `tag` and `branch` arguments are not empty. If either argument is empty, the script prints a usage message and exits.

The script then checks that the `tag` matches the `branch` (unless the `branch` is `master`). The `tag` is expected to be the `branch` name plus a patch number. For example, if the `branch` is `v1.2`, the `tag` should be `v1.2.1`, `v1.2.2`, etc. If the `tag` does not match the expected format, an error message is printed to the console and the script exits with an error code.

The script then uses the `find` command to locate all `Cargo.toml` files in the project directory (excluding certain directories specified in the `ignores` array). For each `Cargo.toml` file found, the script reads the `version` variable from the file using the `readCargoVariable` function (defined in `scripts/read-cargo-variable.sh`). The script then compares the `version` variable to the `tag`. If the `version` variable does not match the `tag`, an error message is printed to the console and the script exits with an error code. If the `version` variable matches the `tag`, a message is printed to the console indicating that the `tag` matches the `manifest`.

This script is used to ensure that the version numbers in the `Cargo.toml` files are consistent with the tag being created. It can be run manually before creating a new tag or it can be integrated into a larger automated build process to ensure that version numbers are consistent across all files. 

Example usage:
```
./confirm-cargo-version-numbers-before-bump.sh v1.2 v1.2.3
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this script do?
- This script checks that the tag matches the branch (unless branch is master) and the Cargo.toml versions match the tag.

2. What is the purpose of the `ignores` array?
- The `ignores` array is used to specify directories that should be ignored when searching for `Cargo.toml` files.

3. What is the significance of the `shellcheck disable=2207` comment?
- The `shellcheck disable=2207` comment is used to disable a specific warning from the `shellcheck` tool, which is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. The warning being disabled is related to the use of an array assignment in the script.
