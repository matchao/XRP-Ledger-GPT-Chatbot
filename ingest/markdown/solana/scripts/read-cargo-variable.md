The `read-cargo-variable.sh` script is used to read a specific variable from a Cargo.toml file. The Cargo.toml file is a configuration file used by Rust's package manager, Cargo, to manage dependencies and build settings for a Rust project. 

The `readCargoVariable()` function takes two arguments: the first argument is the name of the variable to be read, and the second argument is the path to the Cargo.toml file. The function then reads the Cargo.toml file line by line and searches for the specified variable. If the variable is found, the function returns its value without any quotes. If the variable is not found, the function outputs an error message to the standard error stream.

Here is an example usage of the `readCargoVariable()` function:

```
# Read the version variable from the Cargo.toml file
version=$(readCargoVariable "version" "/path/to/Cargo.toml")
echo "The version is $version"
```

In this example, the `version` variable from the Cargo.toml file is read and stored in the `version` variable in the shell script. The value of the `version` variable is then printed to the console.

Overall, this script is useful for extracting specific information from a Rust project's configuration file, which can be used in other parts of the project or in build scripts.
