The `metrics-write-datapoint.sh` script is used to send a metrics datapoint to an Influx database. The script takes in a single argument, which is the datapoint to be sent. If no argument is provided, the script will exit with an error message.

The script first checks if the necessary Influx user credentials are present. If any of the credentials are missing, the script will exit without sending the datapoint. If all the credentials are present, the script will construct a URL to the Influx database using the provided credentials and a default host of `https://internal-metrics.solana.com:8086`. If a different host is specified in the `INFLUX_HOST` environment variable, that host will be used instead.

Finally, the script sends the datapoint to the Influx database using the constructed URL and the `curl` command. The `--max-time 5` option sets a maximum time of 5 seconds for the request to complete, and the `--silent` and `--show-error` options suppress any output from `curl` except for error messages. The datapoint is sent as binary data using the `--data-binary` option.

This script is likely used in the larger Solana project to collect and analyze metrics related to the performance and usage of the Solana blockchain. By sending datapoints to an Influx database, the Solana team can track various metrics over time and use that data to make informed decisions about the project's development and infrastructure. For example, the team could use this data to identify performance bottlenecks or to optimize resource allocation. 

Example usage of the script:
```
./metrics-write-datapoint.sh "solana.block_count,shard=0 value=100"
```
This command sends a datapoint to the Influx database with the measurement `solana.block_count`, a tag of `shard=0`, and a field of `value=100`. The datapoint represents a count of 100 blocks on shard 0 of the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
- This script sends a metrics datapoint to an Influx database.

2. What is the format of the datapoint being sent?
- The format of the datapoint is not specified in the code.

3. What is the significance of the `internal-metrics.solana.com` host?
- The `internal-metrics.solana.com` host is the default host for sending metrics datapoints, but it can be overridden by setting the `INFLUX_HOST` environment variable.
