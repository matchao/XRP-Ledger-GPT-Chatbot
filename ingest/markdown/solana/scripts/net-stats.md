The `net-stats.sh` script is a Bash script that reports network statistics. The script is designed to run on Linux systems and sources a `configure-metrics.sh` script. The script initializes several variables to zero and defines a function called `update_netstat()` that retrieves network statistics using the `netstat` command and updates the variables with the new values. The function uses `awk` to extract specific statistics from the output of the `netstat` command and calculates the difference between the new and old values.

The script then enters an infinite loop that calls the `update_netstat()` function, generates a report string with the differences in network statistics, and writes the report to the console and to a metrics database using the `metrics-write-datapoint.sh` script. The report string contains the differences in packets sent and received, receive errors, receive buffer errors, send buffer errors, RcvbufErrors, InOctets, and OutOctets. The script sleeps for one second before repeating the loop.

This script is useful for monitoring network statistics over time and can be used to identify network issues or anomalies. The script can be integrated into a larger monitoring system to provide real-time network statistics and alerts. For example, the script could be used to monitor the network traffic of a Solana validator node and alert the operator if there are any significant changes in network traffic or errors. 

Example usage:
```
./net-stats.sh
```
This will run the script and continuously output the differences in network statistics to the console and write them to a metrics database.
