The `system-stats.sh` script is a Bash script that reports CPU and RAM usage statistics. The script is designed to be run on a Linux system and is part of a larger project called Solana. The purpose of the script is to collect system metrics and write them to a metrics database. The script uses the `top` command to collect CPU and RAM usage statistics. It also checks if the `nvidia-smi` command is available and if so, collects GPU usage statistics.

The script starts by setting the `set -e` option, which causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails. It then checks if the system is running Linux and exits if it is not. The script then changes the current directory to the parent directory of the script and sources the `configure-metrics.sh` script, which sets up the metrics database.

The script then enters an infinite loop and collects system metrics every second. The loop starts by running the `top` command twice and storing the output in the `top_output` variable. The first run of `top` is inaccurate, so the script runs it twice to get accurate results. The script then uses `grep` and `sed` to extract the CPU usage and RAM usage from the `top_output` variable. The CPU usage is calculated by subtracting the idle usage from 100%, and the RAM usage is calculated by dividing the used memory by the total memory. The script then checks if the `nvidia-smi` command is available and if so, collects GPU usage statistics. The GPU usage statistics are collected by running the `nvidia-smi` command and parsing the output. The script then calculates the average GPU usage and average GPU memory usage. The script then writes the system metrics to the metrics database using the `metrics-write-datapoint.sh` script.

Overall, the `system-stats.sh` script is a useful tool for monitoring system performance on a Linux system. It can be used to collect CPU, RAM, and GPU usage statistics and write them to a metrics database. The script can be run continuously to monitor system performance over time.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this script do?
    
    This script reports CPU and RAM usage statistics, and if nvidia-smi exists, it also reports GPU stats.

2. What is the purpose of the `set -e` command?
    
    The `set -e` command causes the script to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status.

3. What is the purpose of the `awk` command in the script?
    
    The `awk` command is used to perform arithmetic operations on the CPU and RAM usage data to calculate the total CPU usage and RAM usage percentages.
