The `oom-monitor.sh` script is a bash script that reports Linux OOM (Out of Memory) Killer activity. The purpose of this script is to detect when the Linux kernel has killed a process due to a lack of memory and report it. This script is useful in the Solana project because it can help identify memory leaks or other issues that may cause the system to run out of memory.

The script starts by setting the `set -e` option, which causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails. It then changes the current working directory to the directory containing the script.

The script sources two other scripts, `oom-score-adj.sh` and `configure-metrics.sh`, which are located in the same directory as the `oom-monitor.sh` script. These scripts are used to adjust the OOM score and configure metrics, respectively.

The script checks if the current operating system is Linux. If it is not, the script exits with a status of 0. If the syslog file is not readable, the script exits with a status of 1.

The script then adjusts the OOM score to reduce the chance that the script will be killed during an Out of Memory event. This is done using the `oom_score_adj` function from the `oom-score-adj.sh` script. The `self` argument specifies that the OOM score of the current process should be adjusted, and the `-500` argument specifies the amount by which the score should be adjusted.

The script then enters a loop that reads from the syslog file and looks for lines that indicate that a process has been killed by the OOM Killer. When such a line is found, the script extracts the name of the killed process and reports it using the `metrics-write-datapoint.sh` script. The `victim` and `hostname` tags are added to the datapoint to provide additional context.

Finally, the script exits with a status of 1. This is likely a mistake, as it should exit with a status of 0 if it completes successfully.

Example usage:

```
$ ./oom-monitor.sh
Out of memory event detected, firefox killed
Out of memory event detected, chrome killed
```

This output indicates that the OOM Killer has killed the Firefox and Chrome processes due to a lack of memory. The `metrics-write-datapoint.sh` script would also write datapoints to a metrics database, allowing the system to track OOM events over time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script reports Linux OOM Killer activity.

2. What is the significance of the `oom-score-adj.sh` and `configure-metrics.sh` files?

   These files are sourced by the script and provide functionality for adjusting the OOM score and configuring metrics.

3. What is the purpose of the `while` loop in the script?

   The `while` loop reads the syslog file and looks for lines indicating an Out of Memory event, then reports the event and writes a datapoint to the metrics system.
