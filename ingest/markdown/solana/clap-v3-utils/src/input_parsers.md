The `input_parsers.rs` file provides utility functions for parsing command-line arguments in the Solana project. These functions are used to extract values, keypairs, and public keys from the command-line arguments passed to the Solana CLI.

The `values_of` function returns a vector of parsed values for a given argument name. It uses the `FromStr` trait to parse the values, which allows for a wide range of types to be parsed. For example:

```rust
let matches = app().get_matches_from(vec!["test", "--multiple", "50", "--multiple", "39"]);
assert_eq!(values_of(&matches, "multiple"), Some(vec![50, 39]));
```

The `value_of` function returns a single parsed value for a given argument name, while the `keypair_of` function returns a keypair for an argument with a filename or None if not present. The `pubkey_of` function returns a public key for an argument that can be parsed into a public key or is a filename that can be read as a keypair.

There are also functions for handling multiple keypairs and public keys, such as `keypairs_of`, `pubkeys_of`, and `pubkeys_sigs_of`. These functions return vectors of keypairs, public keys, or public key/signature pairs, respectively.

Additionally, there are functions for handling signers, such as `signer_of`, `pubkey_of_signer`, and `pubkeys_of_multiple_signers`. These functions return signers, public keys of signers, or vectors of public keys of multiple signers, respectively.

Other utility functions include `unix_timestamp_from_rfc3339_datetime`, `lamports_of_sol`, `cluster_type_of`, and `commitment_of`, which parse specific types of values from the command-line arguments.

These utility functions are used throughout the Solana CLI to parse user input and perform various operations on the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `STDOUT_OUTFILE_TOKEN` constant?
   **Answer**: The `STDOUT_OUTFILE_TOKEN` constant is a sentinel value used to indicate that the output should be written to the screen (standard output) instead of a file.

2. **Question**: How does the `unix_timestamp_from_rfc3339_datetime` function work?
   **Answer**: The `unix_timestamp_from_rfc3339_datetime` function takes the ArgMatches and a name as input, and tries to parse the value associated with the name as an RFC3339 datetime string. If successful, it converts the datetime to a Unix timestamp and returns it as an Option.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `pubkeys_sigs_of` function?
   **Answer**: The `pubkeys_sigs_of` function is used to parse and return pubkey/signature pairs from the ArgMatches for a given name. The input string should be in the format "pubkey=signature". It returns an Option containing a Vec of tuples with Pubkey and Signature.
