The `blockstore_metrics.rs` file in the Solana ledger module is responsible for collecting and reporting various performance metrics related to the blockstore. The blockstore is a key component of the Solana ledger, responsible for storing and managing shreds (data and coding) that make up the ledger.

The `BlockstoreInsertionMetrics` struct holds various metrics related to the insertion of shreds into the blockstore, such as the time taken for different stages of the insertion process, the number of shreds inserted, and the number of shreds recovered or repaired. The `report_metrics` method in this struct is used to report these metrics as datapoints with a given metric name.

The `BlockstoreRocksDbColumnFamilyMetrics` struct holds metrics related to the RocksDB column family properties, which are relevant to the ledger store performance. These metrics include size-related properties, snapshot-related properties, write-related properties, memory/block cache-related properties, and flush/compaction-related properties. The `report_metrics` method in this struct is used to report these metrics with a specified metric name and column family tag.

The `PerfSamplingStatus` struct holds the current status of RocksDB performance sampling, including the number of RocksDB operations since the last perf sample and the timestamp of the latest operation with perf stats collection. The `should_sample` method in this struct determines whether the current operation should be sampled based on the sample count interval and the time duration between samples.

The `report_rocksdb_read_perf` and `report_rocksdb_write_perf` functions are used to report the collected RocksDB performance metrics for read and write operations, respectively. These functions collect metrics from the `PerfContext` struct, which is a thread-local struct defined in RocksDB for collecting per-thread read/write performance metrics.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `BlockstoreInsertionMetrics` struct and how is it used?
   **Answer**: The `BlockstoreInsertionMetrics` struct is used to store various metrics related to the insertion of shreds into the blockstore. It contains fields to track the elapsed time for different operations, the number of shreds, and other related metrics. The `report_metrics` method is used to report these metrics with a given metric name.

2. **Question**: How does the `BlockstoreRocksDbColumnFamilyMetrics` struct work and what kind of metrics does it expose?
   **Answer**: The `BlockstoreRocksDbColumnFamilyMetrics` struct exposes a subset of RocksDB's internal column family properties that are relevant to the ledger store performance. It includes metrics related to size, snapshots, writes, memory/block cache, flush and compaction, and others. The `report_metrics` method is used to report these metrics with a specified metric name and column family tag.

3. **Question**: How does the `PerfSamplingStatus` struct help in controlling the frequency of RocksDB performance sampling?
   **Answer**: The `PerfSamplingStatus` struct holds the current status of RocksDB perf sampling, including the number of operations since the last perf sample and the timestamp of the latest operation with perf stats collection. The `should_sample` method checks if the current operation should be sampled based on the provided sample count interval and the minimum time duration between samples (`PERF_SAMPLING_MIN_DURATION`). This helps in rate-limiting the performance sampling to avoid excessive overhead.
