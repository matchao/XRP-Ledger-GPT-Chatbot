The `token_balances.rs` file is responsible for collecting token balances associated with transactions in the Solana ledger. It provides a function `collect_token_balances` that takes a reference to a `Bank` and a `TransactionBatch` and returns a `TransactionTokenBalances` object containing token balance information for each transaction in the batch.

The main function, `collect_token_balances`, iterates through each transaction in the batch and checks if the transaction has any SPL Token program associated with it. If it does, it collects token balance information for each account in the transaction using the `collect_token_balance_from_account` function. This information is then stored in a `TransactionTokenBalance` object and added to the `TransactionTokenBalances` vector.

The `collect_token_balance_from_account` function takes a reference to a `Bank`, an account ID, and a mutable reference to a `HashMap` of mint decimals. It checks if the account is owned by a known SPL Token program and if it has a valid token account state. If both conditions are met, it collects the token balance information, including mint, owner, UI token amount, and program ID, and returns it as a `TokenBalanceData` object.

Here's an example of how the `collect_token_balances` function can be used:

```rust
let bank = Bank::new_for_tests(&genesis_config);
let transaction_batch = TransactionBatch::new(sanitized_transactions);
let mut mint_decimals = HashMap::new();

let transaction_token_balances = collect_token_balances(&bank, &transaction_batch, &mut mint_decimals);
```

In this example, `transaction_token_balances` will contain the token balance information for each transaction in the `transaction_batch`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `get_mint_decimals` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `get_mint_decimals` function retrieves the number of decimals for a given mint. It checks if the mint is the native mint, and if so, returns the native mint's decimals. Otherwise, it fetches the mint account from the bank, checks if the mint account owner is a known SPL token ID, and then unpacks the mint account data to get the decimals.

2. **Question**: How does the `collect_token_balances` function work and what is its output?
   **Answer**: The `collect_token_balances` function iterates through sanitized transactions in a given transaction batch and collects token balances for each transaction. It checks if the transaction has a token program, and if so, it collects token balance data for each account in the transaction. The output is a `TransactionTokenBalances` object, which is a vector of vectors containing `TransactionTokenBalance` objects for each transaction.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TokenBalanceData` struct and how is it used in the `collect_token_balance_from_account` function?
   **Answer**: The `TokenBalanceData` struct is used to store token balance information for an account, including the mint, owner, UI token amount, and program ID. In the `collect_token_balance_from_account` function, it is used to collect token balance data for a given account by unpacking the account data, fetching the mint decimals, and constructing a `TokenBalanceData` object with the relevant information.
