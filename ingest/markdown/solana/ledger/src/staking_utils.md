The `staking_utils.rs` file contains utility functions for setting up vote and stake accounts, as well as a test function for converting a collection of vote accounts into a map of staked nodes.

The `setup_vote_and_stake_accounts` function takes in a bank, a keypair for the account making the transaction, a keypair for the vote account, a keypair for the validator identity account, and an amount. It then creates a vote account and a stake account, and delegates the stake to the vote account. This function is useful for setting up a basic staking system for testing purposes.

The `test_to_staked_nodes` function tests the `staked_nodes` method of the `VoteAccounts` struct. It first creates a collection of vote accounts with different stakes and node pubkeys. It then converts this collection into a `VoteAccounts` struct and calls the `staked_nodes` method to get a map of node pubkeys to their corresponding stakes. The function then asserts that the resulting map is correct.

Overall, these utility functions are useful for setting up and testing a staking system in the Solana project. The `setup_vote_and_stake_accounts` function can be used to create basic staking accounts, while the `test_to_staked_nodes` function can be used to test the staking system and ensure that it is working as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `setup_vote_and_stake_accounts` function?
- The `setup_vote_and_stake_accounts` function sets up a vote account and a stake account for a validator, and delegates the stake to the vote account.

2. What is the purpose of the `test_to_staked_nodes` test function?
- The `test_to_staked_nodes` function tests the `staked_nodes` method of the `VoteAccounts` struct, which returns a mapping of validator node public keys to their total stake.

3. What is the purpose of the `process_instructions` function?
- The `process_instructions` function creates a transaction with the given instructions and keypairs, and processes it on the given bank.
