The `BigTableUploadService` struct is responsible for uploading confirmed blocks to Google BigTable. It runs in a separate thread and continuously checks for new blocks to upload. 

The `new` and `new_with_config` methods create a new instance of `BigTableUploadService`. They take in several parameters, including a `Runtime` instance, a `LedgerStorage` instance for BigTable, a `Blockstore` instance, a `BlockCommitmentCache` instance, and several `AtomicU64` instances. The `new` method calls `new_with_config` with a default `ConfirmedBlockUploadConfig`. 

The `run` method is the main logic of the service. It continuously checks for new blocks to upload by getting the highest root that has complete transaction-status metadata and rewards. It then uploads blocks from the current start slot to the end slot, which is the minimum of the highest complete root and the start slot plus twice the maximum number of slots to check. If there are no blocks to upload, it sleeps for one second before checking again. If there is an error during the upload, it logs a warning and sleeps for two seconds before trying again. 

The `join` method waits for the service thread to finish and returns a `thread::Result`.

This code is used in the larger Solana project to upload confirmed blocks to Google BigTable for storage and retrieval. It is part of the ledger module, which is responsible for managing the blockchain data. By uploading blocks to BigTable, the ledger module can retrieve and query the data more efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a service for uploading confirmed blocks to BigTable storage.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `solana_runtime` and `tokio` crates, as well as the `solana_storage_bigtable` and `blockstore` modules from the Solana project.

3. How does the service determine which blocks to upload?
- The service determines the highest slot eligible for upload based on the highest root that has complete transaction-status metadata and rewards, as well as the root from the block commitment cache. It then uploads blocks starting from the first available block up to the end slot determined by this calculation.
