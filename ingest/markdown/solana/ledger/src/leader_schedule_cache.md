The `leader_schedule_cache.rs` file contains the `LeaderScheduleCache` struct, which is responsible for caching leader schedules for a Solana cluster. A leader schedule is a mapping of slots to the leader (validator) responsible for producing a block for that slot. The cache helps to efficiently determine the leader for a given slot without having to recompute the entire schedule each time.

The `LeaderScheduleCache` struct contains the following fields:
- `cached_schedules`: A map of epochs to their respective leader schedules, and a queue to maintain the order of insertion.
- `epoch_schedule`: The epoch schedule configuration for the cluster.
- `max_epoch`: The maximum epoch for which the leader schedule has been computed.
- `max_schedules`: The maximum number of leader schedules to cache.
- `fixed_schedule`: An optional fixed leader schedule for testing purposes.

The `LeaderScheduleCache` provides several methods for interacting with the cache:
- `new_from_bank` and `new`: Constructors that create a new cache instance from a given bank.
- `set_max_schedules`: Sets the maximum number of leader schedules to cache.
- `set_root`: Updates the maximum epoch and computes the leader schedule for the new epoch.
- `slot_leader_at`: Returns the leader for a given slot, computing the leader schedule if necessary.
- `next_leader_slot`: Returns the next consecutive range of slots where a given node will be the leader.
- `set_fixed_leader_schedule`: Sets a fixed leader schedule for testing purposes.

The cache is used in the larger Solana project to efficiently determine the leader for a given slot, which is essential for the correct functioning of the consensus algorithm. For example, when a validator receives a transaction, it needs to know the leader for the current slot to forward the transaction to the correct validator.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `LeaderScheduleCache` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `LeaderScheduleCache` struct is used to cache the leader schedules for different epochs. It provides methods to get the leader for a specific slot, compute the leader schedule for an epoch, and set the root bank, among other functionalities.

2. **Question**: How does the `next_leader_slot` function work and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `next_leader_slot` function returns the next consecutive range of slots (next slot, last slot) after the given current_slot where the given node will be the leader. It takes into account the current slot, the node's pubkey, the bank, an optional blockstore, and a maximum slot range.

3. **Question**: How does the cache handle unconfirmed epochs when requesting the leader for a specific slot?
   **Answer**: When requesting the leader for a specific slot, if the epoch of the requested slot is unconfirmed (greater than the current max_epoch), the cache returns `None`. This is done to avoid providing leader information for unconfirmed epochs.
