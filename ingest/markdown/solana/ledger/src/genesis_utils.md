The code in `genesis_utils.rs` provides utility functions for creating a genesis configuration for the Solana blockchain. The genesis configuration is the initial state of the blockchain, including the initial distribution of tokens, the validator set, and other parameters. 

The `pub use` statement imports three functions from `solana_runtime::genesis_utils`: `bootstrap_validator_stake_lamports`, `create_genesis_config_with_leader`, and `GenesisConfigInfo`. 

The `create_genesis_config` function is a wrapper around `create_genesis_config_with_leader` that adds bootstrap validator staking logic for use in core crate tests. It takes a `mint_lamports` parameter, which is the number of lamports (the smallest unit of account in Solana) to be minted in the genesis configuration. It then generates a new random public key for the leader and calls `create_genesis_config_with_leader` with the mint lamports, leader public key, and the result of `bootstrap_validator_stake_lamports()` as the bootstrap validator stake. 

The `create_genesis_config_with_leader` function takes the same parameters as `create_genesis_config`, but also allows for specifying the leader public key. It creates a new genesis configuration with the specified mint lamports and leader public key, and sets the bootstrap validator stake to the specified value. It returns a `GenesisConfigInfo` struct, which contains the genesis configuration and other information such as the validator identities and their stake.

These functions are used in the Solana codebase to generate the initial state of the blockchain for testing and deployment. For example, in the `fullnode` crate, the `Fullnode` struct is initialized with a genesis configuration generated by `create_genesis_config`. 

Example usage:

```rust
use solana_ledger::genesis_utils::create_genesis_config;

let mint_lamports = 10_000_000;
let genesis_config = create_genesis_config(mint_lamports);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `genesis_utils` module in the `solana_runtime` crate?
- The `genesis_utils` module provides functions for creating and configuring the initial state of a Solana blockchain network.

2. What is the difference between `create_genesis_config` and `create_genesis_config_with_leader`?
- `create_genesis_config_with_leader` is a more specialized version of `create_genesis_config` that includes bootstrap validator staking logic for core crate tests.

3. What is the `bootstrap_validator_stake_lamports` function used for?
- The `bootstrap_validator_stake_lamports` function returns the number of lamports that should be staked by a bootstrap validator in the initial state of a Solana blockchain network.
