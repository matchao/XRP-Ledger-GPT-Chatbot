The `leader_schedule_utils.rs` file contains utility functions for working with leader schedules in the Solana blockchain. A leader schedule is a list of validators that are scheduled to produce blocks during a given epoch. The functions in this file help to generate and manipulate leader schedules.

The `leader_schedule` function takes an epoch and a bank as input and returns the leader schedule for that epoch. It does this by first getting the staked nodes for the epoch from the bank, sorting them by stake, and then creating a new `LeaderSchedule` object using the sorted staked nodes, a seed derived from the epoch, the number of slots in the epoch, and the number of consecutive leader slots. The resulting `LeaderSchedule` object is returned as an `Option`.

The `leader_schedule_by_identity` function takes an iterator of upcoming leaders (represented as slot indices and public keys) and returns a `HashMap` that maps leader base58 identity pubkeys to the slot indices relative to the first epoch slot. This function is used to generate a mapping of leader identities to their scheduled slots.

The `slot_leader_at` function takes a slot and a bank as input and returns the leader for that slot. It does this by first getting the epoch and slot index for the slot from the bank, and then calling the `leader_schedule` function to get the leader schedule for the epoch. The leader for the slot is then returned as an `Option`.

The `num_ticks_left_in_slot` function takes a bank and a tick height as input and returns the number of ticks remaining from the specified tick height to the end of the slot implied by the tick height. This function is used to determine how many ticks are left in the current slot.

The `first_of_consecutive_leader_slots` function takes a slot as input and returns the first slot in the consecutive leader slots sequence that contains the input slot. This function is used to determine the first slot in the sequence of consecutive leader slots.

The `sort_stakes` function takes a mutable vector of stakes (represented as public keys and stake amounts) and sorts them first by stake and then by pubkey to ensure a deterministic result. It then deduplicates the sorted vector in O(n) time. This function is used to sort and deduplicate the staked nodes before creating a `LeaderSchedule` object.

The file also contains a test module that tests the various functions in the file.

Overall, the functions in this file are used to generate and manipulate leader schedules in the Solana blockchain. They are used by other parts of the Solana codebase to schedule block production and determine the current leader for a given slot.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `leader_schedule` function do?
- The `leader_schedule` function takes an epoch and a bank as input and returns an optional `LeaderSchedule` struct that contains the leader schedule for the given epoch.

2. What is the purpose of the `LeaderScheduleByIdentity` type?
- The `LeaderScheduleByIdentity` type is a map that associates leader base58 identity pubkeys with the slot indices relative to the first epoch slot.

3. What is the purpose of the `num_ticks_left_in_slot` function?
- The `num_ticks_left_in_slot` function takes a bank and a tick height as input and returns the number of ticks remaining from the specified tick height to the end of the slot implied by the tick height.
