The `blockstore_options.rs` file defines the configuration options for the Solana blockstore, which is responsible for storing and managing the ledger data. The primary struct in this file is `BlockstoreOptions`, which contains various settings for controlling the blockstore's behavior.

`BlockstoreOptions` has the following fields:

- `access_type`: Determines the access type of the blockstore (Primary, PrimaryForMaintenance, or Secondary).
- `recovery_mode`: Specifies the recovery mode to use when opening the blockstore (TolerateCorruptedTailRecords, AbsoluteConsistency, PointInTime, or SkipAnyCorruptedRecord).
- `enforce_ulimit_nofile`: Controls whether to enforce the limit on the number of open files.
- `column_options`: Contains options for configuring the LedgerColumn, which is responsible for storing shreds (data and coding shreds).

`LedgerColumnOptions` has the following fields:

- `shred_storage_type`: Determines how shreds are stored (RocksLevel or RocksFifo).
- `compression_type`: Specifies the compression type to use for eligible column families (None, Snappy, Lz4, or Zlib).
- `rocks_perf_sample_interval`: Controls the frequency of collecting RocksDB read/write performance samples.

`ShredStorageType` is an enum that defines two storage types for shreds:

- `RocksLevel`: Stores shreds using RocksDB's default compaction (level).
- `RocksFifo`: Stores shreds using RocksDB's FIFO compaction, which allows for more efficient storage reclamation with lower I/O overhead.

`BlockstoreCompressionType` is an enum that defines the available compression types for column families: None, Snappy, Lz4, and Zlib.

`BlockstoreRecoveryMode` is an enum that defines the available recovery modes for the blockstore: TolerateCorruptedTailRecords, AbsoluteConsistency, PointInTime, and SkipAnyCorruptedRecord.

These options can be used to customize the behavior of the blockstore according to the specific requirements of the Solana project. For example, one can choose a different compression type or storage type for shreds to optimize storage space and performance.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `BlockstoreOptions` struct and its fields?
   **Answer**: The `BlockstoreOptions` struct is used to configure the options for the blockstore. It has fields such as `access_type` to specify the access type of the blockstore (Primary, PrimaryForMaintenance, or Secondary), `recovery_mode` to specify whether to open the blockstore under a recovery mode, `enforce_ulimit_nofile` to specify whether to allow an unlimited number of open files, and `column_options` to configure options for the LedgerColumn.

2. **Question**: How does the `BlockstoreRecoveryMode` enum work and what are its possible values?
   **Answer**: The `BlockstoreRecoveryMode` enum is used to specify the recovery mode for the blockstore. It has four possible values: `TolerateCorruptedTailRecords`, `AbsoluteConsistency`, `PointInTime`, and `SkipAnyCorruptedRecord`. Each value represents a different strategy for handling corrupted records during recovery.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ShredStorageType` enum and how is it used in the `LedgerColumnOptions` struct?
   **Answer**: The `ShredStorageType` enum is used to specify the storage type for shreds in the blockstore. It has two possible values: `RocksLevel` and `RocksFifo`. The `LedgerColumnOptions` struct has a field called `shred_storage_type` which is of type `ShredStorageType`, allowing the user to configure the storage type for shreds in the blockstore.
