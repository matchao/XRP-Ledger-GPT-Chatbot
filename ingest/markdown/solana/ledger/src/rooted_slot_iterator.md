The `RootedSlotIterator` struct is a type of iterator that iterates over all the slots in a blockstore that are rooted. A slot is considered rooted if it has been marked as a root slot in the blockstore. A root slot is a slot that is guaranteed to have all its ancestors present in the blockstore. The purpose of this iterator is to provide a way to iterate over all the slots in the blockstore that are rooted, which is useful for various purposes such as verifying the integrity of the blockstore or for iterating over all the slots in the blockstore that have been fully processed.

The `RootedSlotIterator` struct has a `new` method that takes a starting slot and a reference to a `Blockstore` instance. The `new` method returns a new instance of the `RootedSlotIterator` struct if the starting slot is rooted, otherwise it returns an error. The `RootedSlotIterator` struct implements the `Iterator` trait, which means that it has a `next` method that returns the next item in the iterator. The `next` method returns a tuple containing the slot and an optional `SlotMeta` instance for that slot. The `SlotMeta` instance contains metadata about the slot such as the slot's parent, the slot's next slots, and the slot's block height.

The `next` method works by first checking if there are any slots in the `next_slots` vector that are rooted. If there are, it returns the first rooted slot it finds along with its `SlotMeta` instance. If there are no rooted slots in the `next_slots` vector, it creates a new `RootedSlotIterator` instance starting from the previous root slot and iterates over all the rooted slots in the blockstore until it finds the next rooted slot. If it finds a rooted slot, it returns it along with its `SlotMeta` instance. If it doesn't find a rooted slot, it returns `None`.

The `RootedSlotIterator` struct is used in various parts of the Solana project where iterating over all the rooted slots in the blockstore is required. For example, it is used in the `blockstore_processor` module to verify the integrity of the blockstore during the processing of a snapshot. It is also used in the `retransmit_stage` module to iterate over all the slots in the blockstore that have been fully processed and are ready to be retransmitted to other nodes. 

Example usage:

```rust
use solana_ledger::blockstore::Blockstore;

let blockstore = Blockstore::open("path/to/blockstore").unwrap();

// Iterate over all the rooted slots in the blockstore
for (slot, slot_meta) in RootedSlotIterator::new(0, &blockstore).unwrap() {
    println!("Slot: {}", slot);
    if let Some(slot_meta) = slot_meta {
        println!("SlotMeta: {:?}", slot_meta);
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RootedSlotIterator` struct?
- The `RootedSlotIterator` struct is used to iterate over all the slots in a blockstore that are rooted, starting from a given slot.

2. What happens if the `start_slot` passed to `RootedSlotIterator::new` is not rooted?
- If the `start_slot` passed to `RootedSlotIterator::new` is not rooted, an error of type `BlockstoreError::SlotNotRooted` is returned.

3. What is the purpose of the `slot_skipped` variable in the `next` method?
- The `slot_skipped` variable is used to determine whether a slot was skipped during iteration due to a snapshot. If a slot was skipped, its corresponding `SlotMeta` will not be returned.
