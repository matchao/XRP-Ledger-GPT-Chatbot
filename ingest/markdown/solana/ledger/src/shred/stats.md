The `stats.rs` file in the `solana/ledger/src/shred` directory contains two structs: `ProcessShredsStats` and `ShredFetchStats`. These structs are used to collect and report statistics related to the processing and fetching of shreds, which are units of data used in the Solana blockchain.

The `ProcessShredsStats` struct contains fields that represent the elapsed time for various stages of shred processing, such as shredding, serialization, and coding. It also includes a histogram of the number of data shreds obtained from serializing entries, counted in 5 buckets. Additionally, it tracks whether the blockstore already has shreds for the broadcast slot, the number of merkle data and coding shreds, and the residual size of the data buffer. The `submit` method is used to submit the collected statistics to the Solana datapoint system. It takes in the name of the datapoint, the slot, the number of data and coding shreds, and the slot broadcast time. The `record_num_data_shreds` method is used to record the number of data shreds obtained from serializing entries.

The `ShredFetchStats` struct contains fields that represent various statistics related to shred fetching, such as the number of shreds, ping counts, and bad deserializations. The `maybe_submit` method is used to submit the collected statistics to the Solana datapoint system if the elapsed time since the last submission is greater than or equal to the specified cadence.

The `AddAssign` trait is implemented for the `ProcessShredsStats` struct, which allows for the addition of two `ProcessShredsStats` instances. This is useful for aggregating statistics across multiple instances.

Overall, these structs are used to collect and report statistics related to shred processing and fetching in the Solana blockchain. They provide insight into the performance and efficiency of these processes, which can be used to optimize and improve the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProcessShredsStats` struct?
- The `ProcessShredsStats` struct is used to track various statistics related to processing shreds, including elapsed time for different operations, number of data and coding shreds, and histogram count of num_data_shreds.

2. What is the difference between `ShredFetchStats` and `ProcessShredsStats`?
- `ShredFetchStats` is used to track statistics related to fetching shreds, while `ProcessShredsStats` is used to track statistics related to processing shreds.

3. What is the purpose of the `submit` method in `ProcessShredsStats`?
- The `submit` method is used to submit the tracked statistics to a data point logger, and then reset the `ProcessShredsStats` struct to its default values.
