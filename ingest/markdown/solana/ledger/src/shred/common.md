The code in `common.rs` provides common functionality for the `Shred` type used in the Solana project. A `Shred` is a unit of data that is used to represent a portion of the blockchain. The code defines a macro `dispatch!` that is used to dispatch method calls to either a `Legacy` or `Merkle` variant of the `Shred` type. The `Legacy` variant is used for older versions of the Solana blockchain, while the `Merkle` variant is used for newer versions.

The `impl_shred_common!` macro provides a set of common methods that are implemented for both the `Legacy` and `Merkle` variants of the `Shred` type. These methods include `common_header`, `payload`, `into_payload`, `set_signature`, `set_index`, and `set_slot`. The `common_header` method returns a reference to the `ShredCommonHeader` struct, which contains metadata about the `Shred`. The `payload` method returns a reference to the payload data contained in the `Shred`. The `into_payload` method consumes the `Shred` and returns the payload data. The `set_signature` method sets the signature of the `Shred`. The `set_index` and `set_slot` methods are only used for testing purposes and set the index and slot of the `Shred`, respectively.

The `dispatch!` macro is used to define methods for the `Shred` type that can be called on either the `Legacy` or `Merkle` variant. For example, the following code defines a `verify` method that can be called on a `Shred`:

```rust
dispatch!(pub fn verify(&self, pubkey: &Pubkey) -> Result<()>);
```

This code defines a `pub` method called `verify` that takes a reference to a `Pubkey` and returns a `Result` object. The `dispatch!` macro expands this code to create two methods, one for the `Legacy` variant and one for the `Merkle` variant, that call the `verify` method on the appropriate variant of the `Shred`.

Overall, the code in `common.rs` provides a set of common functionality for the `Shred` type used in the Solana project. The `dispatch!` macro allows methods to be defined that can be called on either the `Legacy` or `Merkle` variant of the `Shred`, while the `impl_shred_common!` macro provides a set of common methods that are implemented for both variants.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `dispatch` macro and how is it used in this code?
   - The `dispatch` macro is used to generate multiple function definitions with the same body but different input parameters based on the type of `self`. It is used to implement common functions for two different types of `Shred` structs: `Legacy` and `Merkle`.
2. What functions are implemented by the `impl_shred_common` macro?
   - The `impl_shred_common` macro implements several functions for the `Shred` struct, including `common_header`, `payload`, `into_payload`, `set_signature`, `set_index`, and `set_slot`. These functions are used to manipulate and access different fields of the `Shred` struct.
3. What is the purpose of the `pub(super) use` statement at the end of the code?
   - The `pub(super) use` statement is used to re-export the `dispatch` and `impl_shred_common` macros within the `super` module, which allows them to be used by other modules within the same parent module but not by modules outside of it.
