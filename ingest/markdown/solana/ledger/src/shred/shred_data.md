The `shred_data.rs` file in the Solana project contains the implementation of the `ShredData` struct and its associated methods. The `ShredData` struct is an enum that can hold either a `Legacy` or a `Merkle` variant, which represent different types of data shreds used in the Solana ledger.

The purpose of this code is to provide a common interface for working with both types of data shreds, allowing for easy manipulation and validation of the data they contain. The `ShredData` struct provides a number of methods that can be used to access and modify the data contained within a shred, including methods for retrieving the shred's header information, payload data, and erasure shard data.

One important method provided by the `ShredData` struct is `sanitize()`, which is used to validate the contents of a shred and ensure that it conforms to the expected format. This method checks the size of the payload data, verifies the shred index is within the expected range, and checks the shred flags to ensure they are valid.

Another important method is `resize_stored_shred()`, which is used to resize a shred to the appropriate size for storage in the blockstore. This method checks the type of shred and ensures that it is not a legacy shred, which cannot be resized.

Overall, the `ShredData` struct and its associated methods provide a convenient and flexible way to work with data shreds in the Solana ledger, allowing for easy manipulation and validation of the data they contain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShredData` enum and how is it used in the code?
- The `ShredData` enum represents either a legacy or merkle shred data and is used to dispatch common functions to the appropriate shred type.
2. What is the significance of the `capacity` function and how is it used?
- The `capacity` function returns the maximum size of ledger data that can be embedded in a data-shred, and is used to determine the appropriate shred type based on the size of the merkle proof entries.
3. What is the purpose of the `sanitize` function and what checks does it perform?
- The `sanitize` function performs various checks on a shred to ensure that it is valid, including checking the payload size, shred index, shred flags, and erasure shard index.
