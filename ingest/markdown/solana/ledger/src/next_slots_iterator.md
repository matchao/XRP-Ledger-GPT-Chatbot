The `next_slots_iterator.rs` file contains the implementation of the `NextSlotsIterator` struct and its associated methods. This struct is used to iterate over the next slots in a blockstore given a starting slot. 

The `NextSlotsIterator` struct has two fields: `pending_slots` and `blockstore`. `pending_slots` is a vector of `Slot` types that contains the slots that are yet to be processed. `blockstore` is a reference to a `Blockstore` instance that is used to retrieve the metadata for each slot.

The `NextSlotsIterator` struct has an associated `new` method that takes a starting slot and a reference to a `Blockstore` instance and returns a new `NextSlotsIterator` instance. The `pending_slots` field of the new instance is initialized with a vector containing the starting slot.

The `NextSlotsIterator` struct implements the `Iterator` trait, which requires the implementation of the `next` method. The `next` method returns an `Option` that contains either a tuple of `(Slot, SlotMeta)` or `None`. If `pending_slots` is empty, `None` is returned. Otherwise, the next slot is retrieved from `pending_slots`, and its metadata is retrieved from `blockstore`. If the metadata is present, the next slots are added to `pending_slots`, and the tuple of `(Slot, SlotMeta)` is returned. Otherwise, `None` is returned.

The `tests` module contains a test for the `NextSlotsIterator` struct. The test creates a new `Blockstore` instance and builds a forked block structure with five slots. The `NextSlotsIterator` is then used to iterate over the slots starting from different slots, and the results are compared to the expected values.

Overall, the `NextSlotsIterator` struct provides a convenient way to iterate over the next slots in a blockstore given a starting slot. This can be useful in various parts of the Solana project that require iterating over slots, such as transaction processing and block validation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NextSlotsIterator` struct and how is it used?
   - The `NextSlotsIterator` struct is used to iterate over the next slots in a blockstore starting from a given slot. It is used to build a fork structure in the `test_next_slots_iterator` test function.
2. What does the `next` method of the `Iterator` trait do in this implementation?
   - The `next` method returns the next slot and its corresponding `SlotMeta` from the blockstore. It also updates the `pending_slots` vector with the next slots to be iterated over.
3. What is the purpose of the `test_next_slots_iterator` function and what does it test?
   - The `test_next_slots_iterator` function tests the `NextSlotsIterator` struct by building a fork structure in a blockstore and iterating over the slots using the struct. It tests that the iterator returns the expected slots for different starting slots.
