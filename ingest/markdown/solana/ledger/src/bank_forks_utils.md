The `bank_forks_utils.rs` file contains functions for loading and processing banks in Solana. The `load` function loads banks either from a snapshot or from genesis, and then processes all full blocks in the blockstore. The function takes in several parameters, including the `GenesisConfig`, `Blockstore`, `PathBuf` of account paths, `SnapshotConfig`, `ProcessOptions`, `TransactionStatusSender`, `CacheBlockMetaSender`, `AccountsUpdateNotifier`, and `AtomicBool`. It returns a `LoadResult` which is a `Result` type containing an `Arc<RwLock<BankForks>>`, `LeaderScheduleCache`, and an optional `StartingSnapshotHashes`.

The `load_bank_forks` function is called by the `load` function and loads banks from a snapshot or from genesis. It takes in similar parameters as the `load` function, but also includes a `shrink_paths` parameter. The function returns an `Arc<RwLock<BankForks>>`, `LeaderScheduleCache`, and an optional `StartingSnapshotHashes`.

The `bank_forks_from_snapshot` function is called by the `load_bank_forks` function and loads banks from a snapshot. It takes in similar parameters as the `load_bank_forks` function, but also includes a `full_snapshot_archive_info` and `incremental_snapshot_archive_info` parameter. The function returns an `Arc<RwLock<BankForks>>` and an optional `StartingSnapshotHashes`.

Overall, these functions are used to load and process banks in Solana. The `load` function is likely called at the start of the Solana program to load the necessary banks, while the other functions are called by `load` to perform the actual loading and processing. The `StartingSnapshotHashes` returned by these functions may be used to start a validator or full node from a snapshot.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `load` function?
    
    The `load` function loads the banks via genesis or a snapshot and then processes all full blocks in the blockstore.

2. What is the difference between `load` and `load_bank_forks` functions?
    
    The `load` function calls the `load_bank_forks` function and then processes all full blocks in the blockstore, while the `load_bank_forks` function loads the banks via genesis or a snapshot and returns the bank forks, leader schedule cache, and starting snapshot hashes.

3. What is the purpose of the `bank_forks_from_snapshot` function?
    
    The `bank_forks_from_snapshot` function loads the bank forks from the latest snapshot archives and returns the bank forks and starting snapshot hashes.
