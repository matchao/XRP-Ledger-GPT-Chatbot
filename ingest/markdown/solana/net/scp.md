The `scp.sh` file is a bash script that provides a wrapper around the `scp` command to enable easy file transfer between network nodes in the Solana project. The purpose of this script is to simplify the process of transferring files between nodes by automatically adding the necessary options to access network nodes.

The script starts by setting the `here` variable to the directory path of the script. It then sources the `common.sh` file located in the same directory. The `common.sh` file contains common functions and variables used by other scripts in the `net` directory.

The `usage()` function is defined to display the usage of the script and exit with an appropriate exit code. If an error message is passed as an argument to the function, it is displayed before the usage message.

The script then uses a `while` loop with the `getopts` command to parse command-line options. The only option supported is `-h` or `?`, which displays the usage message.

The `loadConfigFile` function is called to load the configuration file for the Solana project. This file contains variables and settings used by other scripts in the project.

If the script is called with at least one argument, the `scp` command is executed with the necessary options to access network nodes. The `sshOptions` array contains the options to be passed to the `scp` command. The `set -x` command is used to enable debugging output. If no arguments are passed, the `ssh.sh` script located in the same directory is executed.

Overall, the `scp.sh` script provides a convenient way to transfer files between network nodes in the Solana project. It abstracts away the complexity of setting up the necessary options to access network nodes, making it easier for developers to work with the project. 

Example usage:

```
./scp.sh file.txt node1:/path/to/destination
```

This command transfers the `file.txt` file to the `node1` network node at the specified destination path.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is a node scp script that behaves like regular scp with the necessary options to access network nodes added automatically.

2. What is the `usage` function used for?
   
   The `usage` function is used to display the usage information for the script, including the available options and arguments.

3. What is the `loadConfigFile` function used for?
   
   The `loadConfigFile` function is used to load the configuration file for the script, which contains the necessary options and settings for accessing network nodes.
