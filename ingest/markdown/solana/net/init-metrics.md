The `init-metrics.sh` script is used to create a testnet dev metrics database for the Solana project. The script takes in several command-line arguments to specify the database name, username, and whether to create or delete the database. The script also uses a configuration file to read the InfluxDB host and other parameters.

The script first sources a `common.sh` script that contains utility functions. It then defines a `usage` function that prints out the script's usage and exits with an error code if there is an error in the command-line arguments.

The script then parses the command-line arguments using `getopts`. If the `-e` flag is set, the script checks if the `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` environment variable is defined. If it is not defined, the script exits with an error. If the `-c` flag is set, the script sets a flag to create the database without using the configuration file and sets the database name. If the `-d` flag is set, the script sets a flag to delete the database.

The script then reads the username and password for the InfluxDB user. It prompts the user to enter the password and URL encodes it. The script then loads the configuration file if the `-c` flag is not set. It defines a `query` function that sends a query to the InfluxDB server using `curl`. The function takes in a query string and sends it to the server using the `curl` command.

The script then sends a query to drop the database if the `-d` flag is set. If the `-d` flag is not set, the script sends a query to create the database, set the retention policy, and grant read and write permissions to the database. The script then sets the `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` environment variable to the host, database name, and user credentials.

Finally, the script appends the `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` environment variable to the configuration file and exits with a success code.

Example usage:
```
./init-metrics.sh -c testnet-dev myuser
```
This creates a testnet dev metrics database with the name `testnet-dev` using the InfluxDB user `myuser`. The script prompts the user to enter the password for the user. The script then sets the `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` environment variable to the host, database name, and user credentials and appends it to the configuration file.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this script do?
   
   This script creates a testnet dev metrics database for Solana by either reading from a config file or manually specifying a database name, and then grants read and write access to specific users.

2. What is the purpose of the `common.sh` file that is being sourced?
   
   The `common.sh` file contains common functions and variables used by other scripts in the `net` directory.

3. What is the significance of the `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` environment variable?
   
   The `SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG` environment variable is used to specify the host, database name, and user credentials for accessing the metrics database. It is set at the end of the script and exported for use by other scripts.
