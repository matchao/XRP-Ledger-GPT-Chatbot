Next, the script installs the `perf` tool using the `apt-get` package manager. It installs the `linux-tools-common`, `linux-tools-generic`, and `linux-tools-$(uname -r)` packages, which provide the necessary tools for performance monitoring. 

Finally, the script sets up the necessary permissions for using the `perf` tool. It sets the `perf_event_paranoid` kernel parameter to `-1`, which imposes no scope and access restrictions on using `perf_events` performance monitoring. This allows the `perf` tool to access all events and counters on the system. It also sets the `kptr_restrict` kernel p
