The `install-perf.sh` script is a bash script that installs and sets up the `perf` tool on a Linux system. The `perf` tool is a performance monitoring tool that can be used to profile and analyze the performance of a system, including CPU usage, memory usage, and I/O operations. 

The script first checks that the system is running Linux and that the user is root. If either of these conditions is not met, the script exits with an error. 

Next, the script installs the `perf` tool using the `apt-get` package manager. It installs the `linux-tools-common`, `linux-tools-generic`, and `linux-tools-$(uname -r)` packages, which provide the necessary tools for performance monitoring. 

Finally, the script sets up the necessary permissions for using the `perf` tool. It sets the `perf_event_paranoid` kernel parameter to `-1`, which imposes no scope and access restrictions on using `perf_events` performance monitoring. This allows the `perf` tool to access all events and counters on the system. It also sets the `kptr_restrict` kernel parameter to `0`, which allows recording kernel reference relocation symbol to avoid skewing symbol resolution if relocation was used. This ensures that the `perf` tool can accurately profile the system without any interference from kernel relocation. 

Overall, this script is a useful tool for setting up the `perf` tool on a Linux system and ensuring that it has the necessary permissions to accurately profile the system's performance. It can be used as part of a larger project to monitor and optimize the performance of the system. 

Example usage:

```
$ sudo ./install-perf.sh
```

This will install and set up the `perf` tool on the system with the necessary permissions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script is used to install and set up the perf tool for performance monitoring on a Linux system.

2. What are the prerequisites for running this script?
    
    The script can only be run on a Linux system and the user must be root.

3. What permissions and restrictions are being set up by this script?
    
    The script sets up permissions to allow unrestricted use of perf_events performance monitoring and allows recording of kernel reference relocation symbol to avoid skewing symbol resolution if relocation was used.
