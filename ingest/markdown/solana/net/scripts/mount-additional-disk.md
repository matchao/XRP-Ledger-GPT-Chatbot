The `mount-additional-disk.sh` script is designed to mount an additional disk to a specified mount point. The script first sets the mount point to `/mnt/extra-disk` and the disk to `sdb`. It then checks if the disk exists using the `lsblk` command and `grep` to search for the disk name. If the disk does not exist, the script outputs a message indicating that the disk does not exist. 

If the disk exists, the script attempts to mount it to the specified mount point using the `sudo mount` command. If the mount is successful, the script outputs a message indicating that the disk is mounted. If the mount is not successful, the script formats the disk using the `sudo mkfs.ext4` command, creates the mount point directory using `sudo mkdir`, mounts the disk to the mount point using `sudo mount`, and sets the permissions for the mount point using `sudo chmod`. 

Finally, the script checks if the mount was successful using `mount` and `grep`. If the mount was not successful, the script outputs a message indicating that the disk failed to mount and exits with an error code of 1. 

This script can be used in the larger project to automate the process of mounting additional disks to a specified mount point. It can be called from other scripts or used as a standalone script to mount disks. For example, if a node in the Solana network requires additional storage space, this script can be used to mount a new disk to the node. 

Example usage:
```
./mount-additional-disk.sh
```
This will attempt to mount the `sdb` disk to the `/mnt/extra-disk` mount point. If the mount is successful, the script will output a message indicating that the disk is mounted. If the mount is not successful, the script will format the disk, create the mount point directory, mount the disk to the mount point, and set the permissions for the mount point. If the mount is still not successful, the script will output a message indicating that the disk failed to mount and exit with an error code of 1.
## Questions:
