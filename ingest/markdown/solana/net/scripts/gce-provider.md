This script provides utility functions for working with Google Cloud Engine (GCE) instances in the Solana project. It helps manage instances, such as creating, deleting, and finding instances, as well as restarting preempted instances and initializing the network.

The `cloud_DefaultZone` and `cloud_DefaultCustomMemoryGB` functions return default values for the zone and custom memory size, respectively. The `cloud_RestartPreemptedInstances` function restarts any preempted instances with a specified name prefix.

The `__cloud_FindInstances` function is a helper function that finds instances matching a specified filter. It populates the `instances` array with information about the instances, including their name, zone, public IP, and private IP. The `cloud_FindInstances` and `cloud_FindInstance` functions use this helper function to find instances with a specified name prefix or exact name, respectively.

The `cloud_Initialize` function performs one-time initialization for a given testnet, such as creating firewall rules. The `cloud_CreateInstances` function creates one or more identical instances with specified parameters, such as network name, name prefix, number of nodes, machine type, zone, and other optional parameters like GPU support, boot disk size, startup script, and more.

The `cloud_DeleteInstances` function deletes all instances listed in the `instances` array. The `cloud_WaitForInstanceReady` function waits for a newly created VM instance to become responsive, with a specified timeout. The `cloud_FetchFile` function fetches a file from a given instance using GCE's `gcloud compute scp` command.

The `cloud_CreateAndAttachPersistentDisk` function creates a persistent disk with specified size and type, attaches it to a pre-existing VM instance, and sets the disk to auto-delete upon instance deletion. The `cloud_StatusAll` function is not yet implemented for GCE.

Example usage:

```bash
# Find instances with a common prefix
cloud_FindInstances "common-prefix"

# Create an instance with specified parameters
cloud_CreateInstances "networkName" "namePrefix" "numNodes" "enableGpu" "machineType" "zone" "bootDiskSize" "startupScript" "address" "bootDiskType" "additionalDiskSize" "preemptible"
```

These utility functions help manage GCE instances in the Solana project, making it easier to work with instances in a consistent and organized manner.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `cloud_DefaultZone()` function?
   **Answer**: The `cloud_DefaultZone()` function returns the default zone for the GCE instances, which is "us-west1-b" in this case.

2. **Question**: How does the `cloud_RestartPreemptedInstances()` function work?
   **Answer**: The `cloud_RestartPreemptedInstances()` function takes a name prefix as an argument, filters the instances with the given prefix, and restarts any instances with the status "TERMINATED" by calling the `gcloud compute instances start` command.

3. **Question**: What is the difference between the `cloud_FindInstances()` and `cloud_FindInstance()` functions?
   **Answer**: The `cloud_FindInstances()` function finds instances with names matching the specified prefix, while the `cloud_FindInstance()` function finds an instance with a name matching the exact pattern. Both functions use the `__cloud_FindInstances()` function internally with different filters.
