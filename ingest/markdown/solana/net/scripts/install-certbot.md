The `install-certbot.sh` script is a Bash script that installs the Certbot package and creates a script called `certbot-restore.sh` that can be used to obtain SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt. The purpose of this script is to automate the process of obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates for a domain. 

The script first checks that the operating system is Linux and that the user is root. If either of these conditions is not met, the script exits with an error. Then, the script installs the Certbot package using the `apt` package manager. 

Next, the script creates the `certbot-restore.sh` script. This script takes two arguments: the domain name for which to obtain the certificate and the email address of the person responsible for the domain. The script checks that it is being run as root and that the certificate has not already been initialized. If the certificate has already been initialized, the script exits with a success status. 

If the certificate has not been initialized, the script extracts the Let's Encrypt client from a tarball and runs the Certbot client to obtain a certificate for the specified domain. The `--standalone` option tells Certbot to use its own web server to obtain the certificate, rather than using an existing web server. The `--email` option specifies the email address of the person responsible for the domain. The `--agree-tos` option tells Certbot to agree to the Let's Encrypt terms of service. The `-n` option tells Certbot to run in non-interactive mode. 

After obtaining the certificate, the script creates a tarball of the Let's Encrypt configuration files and saves it to disk. The script then copies the private key and certificate files to the root directory for easy access. 

This script is used as part of the Solana project to automate the process of obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates for Solana nodes. By using Let's Encrypt, the Solana project can obtain trusted certificates for free, which helps to secure the communication between nodes. The `certbot-restore.sh` script can be run periodically to renew the certificates before they expire.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script installs certbot and creates a shell script `/certbot-restore.sh` that can be used to obtain SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt for a specified domain and email address.

2. What are the prerequisites for running this script?
   
   This script can only be run on a Linux machine and the user must be root.

3. What is the purpose of the `maybeDryRun` variable and how can it be used?
   
   The `maybeDryRun` variable is used to avoid hitting LetsEncrypt API limits while testing the script. It can be uncommented during testing to enable dry-run mode.
