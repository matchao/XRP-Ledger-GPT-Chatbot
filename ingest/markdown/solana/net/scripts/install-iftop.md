The `install-iftop.sh` script is a bash script that installs the `iftop` package on a Linux system. The purpose of this script is to set up the `iftop` network monitoring tool for use in the Solana project. 

The script begins by setting the shell options `-e` and `-x`. The `-e` option causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails, while the `-x` option causes the shell to print each command before it is executed. 

Next, the script checks that the system is running Linux and that the user is root. If either of these conditions is not met, the script exits with an error code. 

Finally, the script installs the `iftop` package using the `apt-get` package manager. The `--assume-yes` option tells `apt-get` to assume "yes" as the answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. 

This script can be used as part of the Solana project's setup process to ensure that the `iftop` tool is installed on all necessary systems. For example, it could be included in a larger script that sets up a Solana node or validator. 

Example usage:

```
$ sudo ./install-iftop.sh
```

This command would run the script with root privileges and install the `iftop` package on the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script installs iftop, a network monitoring tool, on a Linux system.

2. Why is the `set -ex` command used at the beginning of the script?
   
   The `set -ex` command enables debugging and error checking for the script, which can help identify issues during execution.

3. Why are the `[[ $(uname) = Linux ]]` and `[[ $USER = root ]]` commands used as conditions for the script to exit?
   
   These commands ensure that the script is only executed on a Linux system and by the root user, as installing software on a system can have security implications and should only be done by authorized users.
