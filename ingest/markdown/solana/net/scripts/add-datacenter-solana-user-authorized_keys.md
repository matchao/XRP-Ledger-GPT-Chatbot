The `add-datacenter-solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` script is used to generate a list of public keys for users that should be granted access to all datacenter nodes in the Solana project. The script sources the `solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` file, which defines the list of users and their associated public keys.

The script uses a `for` loop to iterate over the `SOLANA_USERS` array and output an `echo` statement for each user. The `echo` statement sets an environment variable `SOLANA_USER` to the current user and outputs their associated public key. The resulting output can be used to add the public keys to the `authorized_keys` file on each datacenter node, granting the specified users access to all nodes.

This script is useful in the larger Solana project as it simplifies the process of granting access to multiple users across multiple nodes. By defining the list of authorized users and their public keys in a single file, the process of adding and removing users from the authorized list is streamlined. Additionally, the use of environment variables allows for easy management of user-specific settings across all nodes.

Example usage:
```
./add-datacenter-solana-user-authorized_keys.sh > authorized_keys
```
This command generates a list of authorized keys for all datacenter nodes and outputs them to a file named `authorized_keys`. This file can then be distributed to each node and added to the `authorized_keys` file, granting access to the specified users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   This script adds authorized keys for Solana users who should be granted access to all datacenter nodes.

2. What is the source of the `solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` file?
   The `solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` file is sourced from the `net/scripts` directory.

3. What does the `SOLANA_USERS` array contain?
   The `SOLANA_USERS` array contains the public keys for Solana users who should be granted access to all datacenter nodes.
