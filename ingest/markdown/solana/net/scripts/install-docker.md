The `install-docker.sh` script is used to install Docker on a Linux machine. Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, package, and deploy applications as containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient, making them ideal for deploying applications in a variety of environments.

The script first checks that the operating system is Linux and that the user running the script is root. If either of these conditions is not met, the script exits.

Next, the script updates the package list and installs the necessary packages for Docker to run. These packages include `apt-transport-https`, `ca-certificates`, `curl`, and `software-properties-common`.

The script then adds the Docker GPG key to the system and adds the Docker repository to the package manager. This allows the system to download and install Docker.

After updating the package list again, the script installs Docker using the `docker-ce` package.

The script then creates a systemd service file for Docker and sets some configuration options. This service file is used to manage the Docker daemon and ensure that it starts automatically when the system boots.

Finally, the script grants the `solana` user access to Docker by adding the user to the `docker` group. This allows the user to run Docker commands without needing to use `sudo`.

Overall, this script is an important part of the Solana project as it allows developers to easily install Docker and use it to build and deploy Solana applications. By using Docker, developers can ensure that their applications run consistently across different environments and can be easily deployed to production.
