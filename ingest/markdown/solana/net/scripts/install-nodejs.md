The `install-nodejs.sh` script is used to install Node.js, npm, and Yarn on a Linux machine. This script is intended to be used as part of the Solana project, which likely requires Node.js and Yarn to be installed in order to run.

The script first checks that the operating system is Linux and that the user running the script is root. If either of these conditions is not met, the script exits with an error.

Next, the script uses `curl` to download and run a script from the NodeSource repository that adds the Node.js package repository to the system's package manager. The script then installs Node.js and npm using `apt-get`, the Debian package manager. The version of Node.js installed is 10.x, as specified in the URL passed to `curl`.

After Node.js and npm are installed, the script uses `curl` again to download and add the Yarn package repository to the system's package manager. The script then updates the package manager and installs Yarn using `apt-get`. Finally, the script prints the versions of Node.js, npm, and Yarn that were installed.

This script is useful for ensuring that the correct versions of Node.js, npm, and Yarn are installed on a Linux machine for use with the Solana project. By automating the installation process, this script helps to ensure that all developers working on the project have the same environment set up, reducing the likelihood of compatibility issues. 

Example usage:
```
$ sudo ./install-nodejs.sh
```
This will run the script and install Node.js, npm, and Yarn on the machine.
## Questions: 
 1. What version of Node.js is being installed?
   The script is installing version 10.x of Node.js, as specified in the URL for the nodesource setup script.

2. Why is the script checking for the user to be root?
   The script is checking for the user to be root because it needs root privileges to install packages and modify system files.

3. What is the purpose of installing yarn?
   The script is installing yarn, a package manager for Node.js, which may be needed for dependencies or build processes in the project.
