The `remote-node-wait-init.sh` script is used to wait for a remote Solana node to finish initializing before continuing with other tasks. The script takes one argument, which is the maximum amount of time to wait for the initialization to complete (defaulting to 600 seconds if no argument is provided).

The script first sets the `initCompleteFile` variable to `init-complete-node.log`, which is the file that the remote node will create once it has finished initializing. It then defines a function called `waitForNodeToInit`, which is responsible for waiting for the initialization to complete.

The `waitForNodeToInit` function first gets the hostname of the current machine and prints a message indicating that it is waiting for the remote node to boot up. It then sets the `startTime` variable to the current time in seconds and enters a loop that waits for the `initCompleteFile` file to become readable. If the file is not found within the specified wait time, an error message is printed and the script exits with a status code of 1.

While waiting for the file to become readable, the script prints a message indicating how long it has been waiting and sleeps for 5 seconds before checking again. Once the file is found, the function prints a message indicating that the remote node has booted up.

Finally, the script changes to the `~/solana` directory (presumabl
