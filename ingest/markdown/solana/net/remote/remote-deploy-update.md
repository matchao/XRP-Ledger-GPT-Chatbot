The `remote-deploy-update.sh` script is used to deploy updates to the Solana network from a bootstrap validator node. The script takes two arguments: `releaseChannel` and `updatePlatform`. The `releaseChannel` argument specifies which release channel to use for the update, while the `updatePlatform` argument specifies the platform for which the update is intended.

The script first changes the current working directory to the root directory of the Solana project. It then checks if the `deployConfig` file is readable. This file is written by the `remote-node.sh` script and contains configuration information for the node. If the file is not readable, the script exits with an error message.

The `missing` function is defined to print an error message and exit if a required argument is not specified. The script then checks that both `releaseChannel` and `updatePlatform` arguments are specified and that the `update_manifest_keypair.json` file exists. If any of these conditions are not met, the `missing` function is called with an appropriate error message.

If a second argument is provided to the script, it sets the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to that argument. The `net/common.sh` script is sourced to load common functions and variables used by the Solana network scripts. The `loadConfigFile` function is called to load the configuration file for the node.

The script then adds the `~/.cargo/bin` directory to the system `PATH` variable and sets the `-x` option to enable debugging output. Finally, the `solana-install-deploy.sh` script is called with the `--keypair` option set to the path of the `faucet.json` file and the `localhost`, `releaseChannel`, and `updatePlatform` arguments passed in.

Overall, this script is a small part of the Solana network deployment process and is used to deploy updates to the network from a bootstrap validator node. It checks that required files and arguments are present, sets environment variables, and calls the `solana-install-deploy.sh` script to perform the actual deployment.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script is used to deploy updates on the bootstrap validator.

2. What is the significance of the `deployConfig` file?
    
    The `deployConfig` file is used as a source for this script and is written by `remote-node.sh`.

3. What is the purpose of the `solana-install-deploy.sh` script?
    
    The `solana-install-deploy.sh` script is used to install and deploy updates on the specified platform and release channel.
