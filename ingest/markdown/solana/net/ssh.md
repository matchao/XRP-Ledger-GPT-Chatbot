The `ssh.sh` file is a Bash script that provides a simple way to SSH into a node in the Solana network. The purpose of this script is to allow users to easily connect to a Solana node via SSH, without having to remember the IP address of the node or the SSH options required to connect.

The script takes two optional arguments: an IP address and any extra SSH arguments. If an IP address is provided, the script will attempt to SSH into that node using the specified IP address and any extra SSH arguments. If no IP address is provided, the script will display a list of available nodes and their IP addresses.

The script also provides a `printNode` function that is used to display the list of available nodes. This function takes two arguments: the type of node (validator, client, or blockstreamer) and the IP address of the node. The function prints out a formatted string that includes the IP address of the node and a command that can be used to tail the Solana log file for that node.

Here is an example of how to use the `ssh.sh` script:

```
$ ./ssh.sh 192.168.1.100
```

This command will attempt to SSH into the Solana node with the IP address `192.168.1.100`.

Overall, the `ssh.sh` script is a useful tool for developers and users of the Solana network who need to connect to a node via SSH. It simplifies the process of connecting to a node and provides a convenient way to view the log files for each node.
