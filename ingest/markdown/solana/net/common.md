The `common.sh` file contains common utilities that are shared by other scripts in the `net` directory. The purpose of this file is to provide a set of functions and variables that can be used by other scripts to perform common tasks related to network configuration and management.

The first part of the code sets up some variables that are used throughout the file. The `netDir` variable is set to the absolute path of the directory containing the `common.sh` file. The `netConfigDir` variable is set to the path of the `config` directory within the `net` directory. The `SOLANA_ROOT` variable is set to the absolute path of the parent directory of the `net` directory. The `configFile` and `geoipConfigFile` variables are set to the paths of the configuration files used by the network.

The `buildSshOptions` function sets up the `sshOptions` array with a set of options that are used when connecting to remote hosts via SSH. These options include a 20-second connection timeout, batch mode, no strict host key checking, and the use of a specific SSH private key. The `loadConfigFile` function loads the configuration file specified by the `configFile` variable and sets up a number of variables based on the contents of the file. These variables include the `publicNetwork` flag, the `netBasename` string, the `sshPrivateKey` path, and several arrays of IP addresses for validators, clients, and blockstreamers.

The `urlencode` function is a utility function that takes a string as input and returns a URL-encoded version of the string. This function is used by other scripts in the `net` directory to encode strings that are used in URLs.

The `clear_config_dir` function is used to clear the current cluster configuration by deleting the contents of the `config` directory and recreating it. This function is used by other scripts in the `net` directory to reset the network configuration.

Overall, the `common.sh` file provides a set of common utilities that are used by other scripts in the `net` directory to perform common tasks related to network configuration and management. These utilities include functions for setting up SSH options, loading configuration files, encoding strings for use in URLs, and clearing the current cluster configuration.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
- This script contains common utilities shared by other scripts in the `solana/net` directory.

2. What is the purpose of the `loadConfigFile` function?
- The `loadConfigFile` function loads a configuration file and checks that it contains the necessary parameters for the script to run properly.

3. What is the purpose of the `urlencode` function?
- The `urlencode` function encodes a string to be used in a URL by replacing special characters with their corresponding percent-encoded values.
