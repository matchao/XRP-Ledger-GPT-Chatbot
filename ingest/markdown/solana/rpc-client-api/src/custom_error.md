The `custom_error.rs` file in the `rpc-client-api` module of the Solana project defines a set of custom errors that can be returned by the Solana RPC server. These errors are defined as an enum called `RpcCustomError`, which implements the `Error` trait from the `thiserror` crate. Each variant of the enum represents a different type of error that can occur during RPC communication with the Solana server.

The file also defines a set of constants that represent error codes that can be returned by the server. These codes are used to identify the specific type of error that occurred, and are defined as `i64` values.

The `RpcCustomError` enum has a variant for each of the error codes defined in the file. Each variant has a different set of associated data that provides additional information about the error. For example, the `BlockCleanedUp` variant has two associated fields: `slot`, which represents the slot number of the cleaned-up block, and `first_available_block`, which represents the slot number of the first available block on the node.

The file also defines an implementation of the `From` trait for the `EncodeError` type from the `solana_transaction_status` crate. This allows `EncodeError` values to be converted into `RpcCustomError` values, which can then be returned as RPC errors.

Finally, the file defines an implementation of the `From` trait for the `RpcCustomError` type, which allows `RpcCustomError` values to be converted into `Error` values from the `jsonrpc_core` crate. This allows the custom errors to be returned as part of RPC responses.

Overall, this file provides a set of custom errors that can be returned by the Solana RPC server, along with associated error codes and data. These errors can be used to provide more detailed information about errors that occur during RPC communication, and can help clients to diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines custom error types and error codes for the Solana RPC server.

2. What are some examples of specific errors that can be thrown by this code?
- Some examples of specific errors include `BlockCleanedUp`, `SendTransactionPreflightFailure`, `TransactionSignatureVerificationFailure`, and `UnsupportedTransactionVersion`.

3. How are these custom errors converted into JSON-RPC errors?
- The `From<RpcCustomError> for Error` implementation maps each custom error variant to a specific JSON-RPC error with a corresponding error code and message.
