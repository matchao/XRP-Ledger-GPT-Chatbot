The `solana/banking-bench/src/main.rs` file is a benchmarking tool for the Solana banking stage. It generates a series of transactions and processes them through the banking stage, measuring the performance of the system.

The benchmarking tool allows users to configure various parameters, such as the number of iterations, transaction chunks, packets per batch, and write lock contention. It also provides options to skip transaction sanity checks, enable banking tracing, and simulate mint transactions with higher priority.

The main function initializes the benchmarking environment, including creating a genesis configuration, bank, and bank forks. It also sets up the PohRecorder, BankingStage, and other necessary components for processing transactions.

The tool generates a series of transactions using the `make_accounts_txs` function, which creates transfer transactions with varying levels of write lock contention and optional mint simulation. The transactions are then grouped into packet batches using the `PacketsPerIteration` struct.

During each iteration, the tool sends the packet batches to the banking stage for processing. It then checks if the transactions have been processed by the bank and updates the bank and PohRecorder accordingly. Performance metrics, such as the total number of transactions sent and processing times, are collected and printed at the end of the benchmark.

Example usage:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --iterations 1000 --num-chunks 16 --packets-per-batch 192 --write-lock-contention None
```

This command runs the benchmark with 1000 iterations, 16 transaction chunks, 192 packets per batch, and no write lock contention.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `WriteLockContention` enum and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `WriteLockContention` enum is used to specify the level of write lock contention for the accounts in the test transactions. It has three possible values: `None`, `SameBatchOnly`, and `Full`. It is used in the `make_accounts_txs` function to determine the account keys for the transactions based on the specifie
