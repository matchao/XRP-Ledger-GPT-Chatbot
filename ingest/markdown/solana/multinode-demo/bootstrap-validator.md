The `bootstrap-validator.sh` script is used to start the bootstrap validator node for the Solana network. The bootstrap validator is a node that is responsible for creating the initial blocks of the blockchain and propagating them to other nodes in the network. This script sets up the necessary configuration and starts the validator process.

The script first sources a `common.sh` file that contains common functions and variables used by other scripts in the project. It then checks if the system has a GPU installed, which is required for the Solana testnet. If no GPU is found, the script exits with an error message.

The script then sets the `program` variable to the path of the validator binary, depending on whether the system has CUDA support or not. It then parses command-line arguments passed to the script and sets up the necessary configuration files and directories for the validator.

The script then starts the validator process in a loop, which will automatically restart the validator if it crashes or exits for any reason. The loop also allows for the validator to be stopped by sending an interrupt signal to the script.

Overall, this script is an essential part of the Solana project, as it allows for the creation and maintenance of the bootstrap validator node, which is a critical component of the Solana network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script starts the bootstrap validator node.

2. What arguments can be passed to this script?
    
    This script accepts various arguments such as `--init-complete-file`, `--gossip-host`, `--gossip-port`, `--dev-halt-at-slot`, `--dynamic-port-range`, `--limit-ledger-size`, `--no-rocksdb-compaction`, `--enable-rpc-transaction-history`, `--rpc-pubsub-enable-block-subscription`, `--enable-cpi-and-log-storage`, `--enable-extended-tx-metadata-storage`, `--enable-rpc-bigtable-ledger-storage`, `--tpu-disable-quic`, `--tpu-enable-udp`, `--rpc-send-batch-ms`, `--rpc-send-batch-size`, `--skip-poh-verify`, `--log`, `--no-restart`, `--wait-for-supermajority`, `--expected-bank-hash`, `--accounts`, `--maximum-snapshots-to-retain`, `--no-snapshot-fetch`, `--accounts-db-skip-shrink`, `--skip-require-tower`, and `--log-messages-bytes-limit`.

3. What happens if the `SOLANA_GPU_MISSING` environment variable is set to 1?
    
    If the `SOLANA_GPU_MISSING` environment variable is set to 1, the script will print an error message stating that testnet requires GPUs but none were found, and then exit with an error code of 1.
