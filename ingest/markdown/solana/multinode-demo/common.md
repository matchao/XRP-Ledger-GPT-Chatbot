The `common.sh` file contains common utilities that are shared by other scripts in the same directory. The purpose of this file is to provide a set of functions that can be used by other scripts to perform common tasks. 

The first section of the code disables complaints about unused variables in the file. This is done to prevent warnings from being generated when the code is run. 

The next section of the code checks if the `--prebuild` flag has been passed as an argument. If it has, the `prebuild` variable is set to `true`. 

The following section of the code checks if the operating system is Linux. If it is not, the code checks if the `SOLANA_CUDA` variable is set. If it is, a warning is printed to the console indicating that CUDA is not supported on the current operating system. 

The next section of the code checks if the `USE_INSTALL` variable is set or if the `Cargo.toml` file does not exist in the `SOLANA_ROOT` directory. If either of these conditions is true, the `solana_program` function is defined to return the name of the Solana program. Otherwise, the function is defined to build and run the Solana program using the `cargo` command. 

The `solana_program` function takes a program name as an argument and returns the name of the Solana program. If no program name is provided, the function returns `solana`. If a program name is provided, the function returns `solana-program_name`. 

The `solana_bench_tps`, `solana_faucet`, `solana_validator`, `solana_validator_cuda`, `solana_genesis`, `solana_gossip`, `solana_keygen`, `solana_ledger_tool`, and `solana_cli` variables are defined to hold the names of various Solana programs. 

The `default_arg` function takes a name and a value as arguments and adds them to the `args` array if the name is not already present in the array. 

The `replace_arg` function takes a name and a value as arguments and replaces the value of the argument in the `args` array if the name is already present in the array. 

Overall, the `common.sh` file provides a set of functions that can be used by other scripts in the same directory to perform common tasks related to building and running Solana programs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
- This script contains common utilities shared by other scripts in the same directory.

2. What is the significance of the `--prebuild` flag?
- If the script is called with the `--prebuild` flag, it will prebuild binaries so that CI sanity check timeout doesn't include build time.

3. What is the purpose of the `solana_program` function?
- The `solana_program` function returns the command to run a Solana program, and can be used to prebuild binaries and set the appropriate toolchain.
