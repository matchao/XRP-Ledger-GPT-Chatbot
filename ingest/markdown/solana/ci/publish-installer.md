The `publish-installer.sh` script is used to publish the Solana install wrapper to the release website. The install wrapper is a script that installs the Solana software on a user's machine. The purpose of this script is to automate the process of publishing the install wrapper to the release website.

The script first checks if the `DO_NOT_PUBLISH_TAR` environment variable is set. If it is set, the script exits without publishing the install wrapper. This is useful for local development where the install wrapper does not need to be published.

Next, the script checks the channel and tag information using the `channel-info.sh` script. If the `CI_TAG` environment variable is set, the `CHANNEL_OR_TAG` variable is set to the value of `CI_TAG`. Otherwise, `CHANNEL_OR_TAG` is set to the value of `CHANNEL`. If `CHANNEL_OR_TAG` is not set, the script exits.

The script then creates a file called `release.solana.com-install` that contains the release information and the contents of the `solana-install-init.sh` script. The `solana-install-init.sh` script is the actual install wrapper that is executed on the user's machine. The `release.solana.com-install` file is uploaded to the release website using the `upload-s3-artifact` function. Finally, the script outputs the URL of the published install wrapper.

This script is used in the larger Solana project to automate the process of publishing the install wrapper to the release website. By automating this process, developers can easily publish new versions of the install wrapper without having to manually upload the file to the release website. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors.
