The `upload-github-release-asset.sh` script is used to upload one or more files to a GitHub release. The script requires two environment variables to be set: `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `CI_TAG`. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is an authentication token that allows the script to upload files to the GitHub release. The `CI_TAG` is the tag of the GitHub release to which the files will be uploaded.

The script first checks if any files have been specified as arguments. If no files have been specified, the script prints an error message and exits. If files have been specified, the script checks if the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `CI_TAG` environment variables have been set. If either of these variables is not set, the script prints an error message and exits.

The script then sets the `CI_REPO_SLUG` environment variable to `solana-labs/solana`. This variable is used to specify the repository to which the files will be uploaded. The script uses the `curl` command to retrieve the release ID of the GitHub release specified by the `CI_TAG` environment variable. The release ID is used to upload the files to the correct release. The script then loops through each file specified as an argument and uploads it to the GitHub release using the `curl` command.

This script is used in the Solana project to automate the process of uploading files to GitHub releases. It can be used by developers to upload files such as binaries, documentation, or release notes to a GitHub release. By automating this process, the script saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to upload one or more files to a Github release.

2. What are the prerequisites for running this script?
   
   The prerequisites for running this script are that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `CI_TAG` environment variables must be defined.

3. Why is `CI_REPO_SLUG` being forced to a specific value?
   
   `CI_REPO_SLUG` is being forced to a specific value because sometimes `BUILDKITE_TRIGGERED_FROM_BUILD_PIPELINE_SLUG` is not set correctly, causing the artifact upload to fail.
