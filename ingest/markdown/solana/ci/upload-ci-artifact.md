The code provided in `upload-ci-artifact.sh` is responsible for uploading artifacts generated during the build process to either the Buildkite artifact store or an S3 bucket. 

The `upload-ci-artifact()` function takes a single argument, which is the path to the artifact file. It first prints a message indicating the name of the artifact being uploaded. If the file is readable, it prints its size and then checks if the `BUILDKITE` environment variable is set to `true`. If it is, it uploads the artifact to the Buildkite artifact store using the `buildkite-agent` command. If the file is not readable, it prints an error message indicating that the file was not found.

The `upload-s3-artifact()` function takes two arguments: the path to the artifact file and the S3 bucket URL to which the artifact should be uploaded. It first prints a message indicating the name of the artifact and the destination bucket. It then sets up a Docker container with the `eremite/aws-cli:2018.12.18` image, which contains the AWS CLI tool. The container is run with the necessary environment variables and volume mounts to allow it to access the artifact file and the AWS credentials. Finally, the `s3cmd` command is used to upload the artifact to the specified S3 bucket.

These functions are likely used in the larger Solana project to automate the process of uploading build artifacts to various storage locations. For example, the `upload-ci-artifact()` function may be used to upload artifacts to the Buildkite artifact store, which is a common practice in continuous integration and deployment pipelines. The `upload-s3-artifact()` function may be used to upload artifacts to an S3 bucket, which is a common practice for storing and distributing build artifacts in cloud-based environments. By providing these functions, the Solana project makes it easier for developers to manage and distribute build artifacts as part of their development workflow. 

Example usage of `upload-ci-artifact()`:
```
$ upload-ci-artifact build/my_artifact.zip
--- artifact: build/my_artifact.zip
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 12345 Jan 1 00:00 build/my_artifact.zip
Uploading artifact to Buildkite artifact store...
```

Example usage of `upload-s3-artifact()`:
```
$ upload-s3-artifact build/my_artifact.zip s3://my-bucket/my_artifact.zip
--- artifact: build/my_artifact.zip to s3://my-bucket/my_artifact.zip
Uploading artifact to S3 bucket...
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script is used to upload artifacts to a CI/CD pipeline or to an S3 bucket.

2. What is the difference between `upload-ci-artifact` and `upload-s3-artifact` functions?
   - `upload-ci-artifact` is used to upload artifacts to a CI/CD pipeline, while `upload-s3-artifact` is used to upload artifacts to an S3 bucket.

3. What is the purpose of the `args` array in the `upload-s3-artifact` function?
   - The `args` array is used to pass arguments to the `docker run` command, including environment variables, volumes, and the Docker image to use.
