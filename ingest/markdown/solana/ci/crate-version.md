The `crate-version.sh` file is a Bash script that outputs the current version of a Rust crate from a given `Cargo.toml` file. This script is used in the Solana project to automate the process of updating the version of a crate during the build process.

The script takes one argument, which is the path to the `Cargo.toml` file. If no argument is provided, the script prints a usage message and exits. If the file is not readable, the script prints an error message and exits.

The script then reads the `Cargo.toml` file line by line and searches for the line that contains the version number of the crate. Once the line is found, the script extracts the version number and removes any quotes around it. The version number is then printed to the console and the script exits with a success status.

If the script is unable to locate the version number in the `Cargo.toml` file, it prints an error message to the standard error stream and exits with a failure status.

Here is an example of how this script can be used in the Solana project:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Get the current version of the solana-program crate
version=$(ci/crate-version.sh programs/bpf/Cargo.toml)

# Use the version number to build the solana-program Docker image
docker build -t solanalabs/solana-program:$version programs/bpf
```

In this example, the `crate-version.sh` script is used to get the current version of the `solana-program` crate from its `Cargo.toml` file. The version number is then used to build a Docker image for the `solana-program` crate. This allows the Solana project to automate the process of building and deploying new versions of its crates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script outputs the current version of a crate from a given Cargo.toml file.

2. What is the expected input format for this script?
   
   The expected input format is the path to a Cargo.toml file.

3. What happens if the version cannot be located in the Cargo.toml file?
   
   If the version cannot be located in the Cargo.toml file, the script outputs an error message and exits with a status of 1.
