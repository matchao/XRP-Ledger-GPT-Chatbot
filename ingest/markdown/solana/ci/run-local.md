The `run-local.sh` script is a Bash script that automates the execution of a series of tests and checks for the Solana project. The purpose of this script is to provide a convenient way for developers to run the tests and checks locally on their machines before pushing changes to the repository.

The script starts by changing the current working directory to the root of the Solana project. It then sets an environment variable `CI_LOCAL_RUN` to `true`, which is used by other scripts in the project to determine if they are being run locally or on a CI server.

The script defines an array `steps` that contains the names of the tests and checks to be executed. Each element in the array corresponds to a shell script in the `ci/` directory that performs a specific test or check. The script then iterates over the `steps` array and executes each script in turn.

The script also provides an optional argument that allows the user to specify a starting point in the `steps` array. If the argument is provided, the script searches for the specified step in the array and starts executing from that point. If the specified step is not found in the array, the script prints an error message and exits.

Overall, this script provides a convenient way for developers to run the tests and checks for the Solana project locally. By automating the execution of these tests and checks, the script helps ensure that changes to the project are thoroughly tested before being pushed to the repository. 

Example usage:
```
./run-local.sh test-coverage
```
This will start the script at the `test-coverage` step and execute all remaining steps in the `steps` array.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script is used to run a series of tests and checks for the Solana project locally.

2. What are the different steps that this script executes?
   - The script executes a series of steps, including test-sanity, shellcheck, test-checks, test-coverage, test-stable, test-stable-sbf, test-stable-perf, test-downstream-builds, test-bench, test-local-cluster, test-local-cluster-flakey, test-local-cluster-slow-1, and test-local-cluster-slow-2.

3. How does this script handle starting at a specific step?
   - If a start step is provided as an argument to the script, it will find the index of that step in the list of steps and start executing from that step. If the start step is not found, the script will exit with an error message.
