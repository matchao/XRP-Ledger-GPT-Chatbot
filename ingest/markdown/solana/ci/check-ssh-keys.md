The `check-ssh-keys.sh` script is a security measure that checks for the presence of RSA keys in the `solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` file. If any RSA keys are found, the script will exit with an error message indicating that RSA keys are not allowed due to their small key sizes being insecure.

This script is likely used as part of a larger security protocol for the Solana project, which is a blockchain platform designed for high-performance decentralized applications. SSH keys are commonly used for secure remote access to servers, and the presence of RSA keys in particular may be seen as a security risk due to their vulnerability to brute-force attacks.

Here is an example of how this script might be used in a larger security protocol:

1. A user attempts to access a Solana server via SSH.
2. The server checks the user's SSH key against the `solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` file.
3. If any RSA keys are found in the file, the server denies the user access and logs the attempt.
4. If no RSA keys are found, the server grants the user access and logs the attempt.

Overall, the `check-ssh-keys.sh` script serves as a simple but effective security measure to prevent unauthorized access to Solana servers via R
