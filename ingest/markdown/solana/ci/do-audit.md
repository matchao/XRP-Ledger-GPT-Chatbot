The `do-audit.sh` script is a bash script that is used to run security audits on the Solana project's Rust codebase. The script uses the `cargo audit` command to check for any known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. The script also includes a filter to remove unnecessary output from the `cargo audit` command.

The script takes an optional command-line argument `--display-dependency-trees` that will display the full dependency tree for each crate. By default, the script filters out the dependency tree output to only show the direct dependencies of the project.

The script also includes a list of vulnerabilities to ignore when running the `cargo audit` command. These vulnerabilities are known issues that are either blocked on upstream dependencies updating or are stopgap measures to unblock CI.

The script is run as part of the Solana project's continuous integration (CI) pipeline to ensure that any new code changes do not introduce any new security vulnerabilities. The script is also useful for developers who want to manually check for any security issues in the project's dependencies.

Example usage:
```
./ci/do-audit.sh --display-dependency-trees
```
This command will run the security audit and display the full dependency tree for each crate.

```
./ci/do-audit.sh
```
This command will run the security audit and only display the direct dependencies of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to run a security audit on the Solana project's dependencies using `cargo-audit`.

2. What is the significance of the `dep_tree_filter` variable?
   
   The `dep_tree_filter` variable is used to filter out the dependency tree output from `cargo-audit` to make it more readable. If the `--display-dependency-trees` flag is passed, the filter is disabled.

3. Why are certain vulnerabilities being ignored in `cargo_audit_ignores`?
   
   Certain vulnerabilities are being ignored in `cargo_audit_ignores` because they are either blocked on upstream dependencies updating, or are stopgaps to unblock CI.
