The `run-spl.sh` script is a bash script that is used to run the Solana Programming Language (SPL) downstream projects. The script sets the shell to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status (`set -e`). 

The script then sets the `here` variable to the directory name of the script (`$(dirname "$0")`). This is used to reference other scripts in the same directory. 

The script then sources two other scripts: `func-spl.sh` and `common.sh`. The `func-spl.sh` script contains functions specific to the SPL downstream projects, while the `common.sh` script contains functions that are common to all downstream projects. 

Finally, the script calls the `_ spl` function, which is defined in `func-spl.sh`. This function sets up the environment for the SPL downstream projects and runs the appropriate command to build and test the projects. 

Overall, this script is used to automate the process of building and testing the SPL downstream projects. It is likely used as part of a larger build and test pipeline for the Solana project. 

Example usage:

```
./run-spl.sh
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `func-spl.sh` and `common.sh` files being sourced in this script?
   
   The `func-spl.sh` and `common.sh` files are being sourced to provide additional functions and variables needed for the script to run properly.

2. What is the significance of the underscore before `spl` in the last line of the script?
   
   The underscore before `spl` is a convention used to indicate that the function is intended to be used internally within the script and not meant to be called externally.

3. What does the `set -e` command do at the beginning of the script?
   
   The `set -e` command sets the script to exit immediately if any command within it exits with a non-zero status, indicating an error.
