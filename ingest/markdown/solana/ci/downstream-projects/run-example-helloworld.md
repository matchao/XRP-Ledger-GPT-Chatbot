The `run-example-helloworld.sh` script is a Bash script that is used to run an example program called `example_helloworld`. The purpose of this script is to automate the process of running the example program by sourcing two other scripts, `func-example-helloworld.sh` and `common.sh`, and then calling the `example_helloworld` function.

The first line of the script, `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell. The second line, `set -e`, sets the shell option to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status.

The `here` variable is set to the directory containing the script using the `dirname` command. This is used later to source the two other scripts.

The `source` command is used twice to source the `func-example-helloworld.sh` and `common.sh` scripts. Sourcing a script means that the commands in the script are executed in the current shell environment, rather than in a subshell. This allows the variables and functions defined in the sourced scripts to be used in the current script.

Finally, the `_ example_helloworld` command calls the `example_helloworld` function, which is defined in the `func-example-helloworld.sh` script. This function is responsible for running the example program.

Overall, this script is a small but important part of the Solana project, as it provides a simple way to run an example program and test the functionality of the Solana platform. It can be used by developers who are working on the project to quickly test changes and ensure that everything is working as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `func-example-helloworld.sh` file?
   - The `func-example-helloworld.sh` file is sourced to provide functions for the `run-example-helloworld.sh` script.

2. What is the `common.sh` file used for?
   - The `common.sh` file is sourced to provide common functions for downstream projects.

3. What does the `_ example_helloworld` line do?
   - The `_ example_helloworld` line calls the `example_helloworld` function defined in `func-example-helloworld.sh`.
