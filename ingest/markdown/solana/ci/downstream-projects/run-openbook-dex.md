The `run-openbook-dex.sh` script is a bash script that is used to run the OpenBook DEX (Decentralized Exchange) project. The script sets the shell to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status (`set -e`). 

The script then sets the `here` variable to the directory name of the script. This is done using the `dirname` command. 

The script then sources two other shell scripts: `func-openbook-dex.sh` and `common.sh`. The `source` command is used to execute the contents of the specified file in the current shell environment. 

The `func-openbook-dex.sh` script contains functions that are used to build and run the OpenBook DEX project. The `common.sh` script contains common functions that are used across multiple downstream projects. 

Finally, the script calls the `_ openbook_dex` function. This function is defined in the `func-openbook-dex.sh` script and is responsible for building and running the OpenBook DEX project. 

Overall, this script is used to automate the process of building and running the OpenBook DEX project. It is likely used as part of a larger build and deployment pipeline for the project. 

Example usage:
```
./run-openbook-dex.sh
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `func-openbook-dex.sh` and `common.sh` files being sourced in this script?
   
   The `func-openbook-dex.sh` file likely contains functions specific to the OpenBook DEX project, while the `common.sh` file likely contains functions and variables used across multiple downstream projects. Sourcing these files allows the script to access their contents.

2. What does the `_` before the `openbook_dex` command signify?
   
   The underscore before the `openbook_dex` command is a convention used to indicate that the command is a function. It is not necessary for the command to function properly.

3. What is the purpose of the `set -e` command at the beginning of the script?
   
   The `set -e` command causes the script to exit immediately if any command within it returns a non-zero exit status, indicating an error. This helps to ensure that errors are caught and addressed as soon as possible.
