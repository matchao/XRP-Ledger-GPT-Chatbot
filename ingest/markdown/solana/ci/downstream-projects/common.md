The `common.sh` file is a script that sets up environment variables and directories for downstream projects that depend on the Solana project. The purpose of this script is to ensure that the downstream projects are using the correct version of Solana and have access to the necessary build tools.

The script starts by setting the `SOLANA_VER` environment variable to the version number of Solana specified in the `Cargo.toml` file. This variable is then exported so that it can be used by downstream projects. The `SOLANA_DIR` environment variable is also set to the current working directory, which is the root directory of the Solana project. This variable is also exported so that downstream projects can reference it.

The script then sets up three additional environment variables: `CARGO`, `CARGO_BUILD_SBF`, and `CARGO_TEST_SBF`. These variables are set to the paths of the `cargo`, `cargo-build-sbf`, and `cargo-test-sbf` executables, respectively. These executables are used by Solana to build and test programs, and they are included in the Solana project's `cargo` directory. By setting these environment variables, downstream projects can use the same build tools as Solana.

Finally, the script creates a `target/downstream-projects` directory if it does not already exist and changes the current working directory to that directory. This directory is where downstream projects will be built and tested.

Overall, this script is an important part of the Solana project's build process. By setting up the correct environment variables and directories, downstream projects can easily build and test against the correct version of Solana and use the same build tools as Solana. Here is an example of how a downstream project might use these environment variables:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

source solana/ci/downstream-projects/common.sh

# Build and test the downstream project using the same tools as Solana
$CARGO build
$CARGO_TEST_SBF
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    - This script sets environment variables and creates a directory for downstream projects.

2. What is the significance of the `set -e` command?
    - The `set -e` command causes the script to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status.

3. What are the `source` commands doing?
    - The `source` commands are importing functions and variables from other scripts located in the `ci/`, `scripts/`, and `ci/semver_bash/` directories.
