The `sbf-tools-info.sh` script is used to find the version of sbf-tools used by the source tree of the project. This script is executed in a bash environment and its output can be evaluated. 

The purpose of this script is to determine the version of sbf-tools used by the project. sbf-tools is a Rust crate that provides a set of tools for working with the Solana Binary Format (SBF). The SBF is a binary format used to represent Solana programs. 

The script first sets the `SBF_TOOLS_VERSION` variable to "unknown". It then checks if the `cargo-build-sbf` main file exists in the source tree. If it does, the script uses `sed` to extract the version number from the `cargo-build-sbf` main file. The extracted version number is then assigned to the `SBF_TOOLS_VERSION` variable. If the version number cannot be extracted, the script outputs an error message. If the `cargo-build-sbf` main file does not exist, the script outputs a message indicating that the file is not present. 

Here is an example of how this script can be used in the larger project:

```bash
eval "$(./ci/sbf-tools-info.sh)"
echo "SBF Tools Version: ${SBF_TOOLS_VERSION}"
```

This code will execute the `sbf-tools-info.sh` script and evaluate its output. The version of sbf-tools used by the project will be stored in the `SBF_TOOLS_VERSION` variable. The script then outputs the version number.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script is used to find the version of sbf-tools used by the source tree.

2. How does the script determine the sbf-tools version?
    
    The script determines the sbf-tools version by parsing the `cargo-build-sbf/src/main.rs` file and extracting the version number from the `sbf_tools_version` string.

3. What is the output of this script?
    
    The output of this script is the value of the `SBF_TOOLS_VERSION` variable, which is either the version number of sbf-tools or "unknown" if the version cannot be determined.
