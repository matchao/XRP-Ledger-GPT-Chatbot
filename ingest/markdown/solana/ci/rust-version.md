The `rust-version.sh` file is responsible for maintaining the Rust versions used by the Continuous Integration (CI) system. The purpose of this file is to provide a way to obtain the environment variables for both stable and nightly Rust versions, which can be used to build the project. 

The file can be sourced to obtain the environment variables without any automatic toolchain updating. The following commands can be used to obtain the environment variables updating both stable and nightly, only stable, or only nightly:

```
$ source ci/rust-version.sh all
$ source ci/rust-version.sh stable
$ source ci/rust-version.sh nightly
```

After obtaining the environment variables, the project can be built using either stable or nightly Rust versions. The following commands can be used to build the project:

```
$ cargo +"$rust_stable" build
$ cargo +"$rust_nightly" build
```

The file first checks if the `RUST_STABLE_VERSION` and `RUST_NIGHTLY_VERSION` environment variables are set. If they are set, the corresponding Rust versions are used. Otherwise, the Rust version is read from the `rust-toolchain.toml` file using the `readCargoVariable` function from the `read-cargo-variable.sh` script. 

If the `RUST_NIGHTLY_VERSION` environment variable is not set, the default nightly version `2023-01-22` is used. 

The file then exports the environment variables `rust_stable`, `rust_stable_docker_image`, `rust_nightly`, and `rust_nightly_docker_image`. These environment variables are used to build the project with the corresponding Rust versions. 

Finally, the file checks if an argument is passed to the script. If an argument is passed, the `rustup_install` function is called to install the corresponding Rust toolchain. The `rustup_install` function checks if the toolchain is already installed and installs it if it is missing. The `set -e` command is used to exit the script if any command fails. 

In summary, the `rust-version.sh` file is responsible for maintaining the Rust versions used by the CI system. It provides a way to obtain the environment variables for both stable and nightly Rust versions, which can be used to build the project. The file also provides a way to install the corresponding Rust toolchain if an argument is passed to the script.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script maintains the rust versions for use by CI and sets environment variables for stable and nightly versions of Rust.

2. How are the Rust versions determined if environment variables are not set?
    
    If environment variables are not set, the script reads the Rust version from the `rust-toolchain.toml` file using the `readCargoVariable` function.

3. What is the purpose of the `rustup_install` function?
    
    The `rustup_install` function installs a given Rust toolchain if it is not already installed and prints its version. It is used to ensure that the required Rust toolchains are available for building.
