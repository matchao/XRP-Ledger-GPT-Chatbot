The `intercept.sh` file is a Bash script that intercepts standard error (stderr) output and logs it to a file. It is designed to be used in a continuous integration (CI) environment, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, where it is important to capture all output from a build or test run. 

The script first checks if the environment variable `$CI` is set and `$NO_INTERCEPT` is not set. If both conditions are true, it creates a log file with a timestamp in the filename and sets the variable `console_log` to the path of the log file. It then echoes a message to the console indicating that stderr output is being intercepted and logged to the file. 

The script then uses a Bash process substitution to redirect stdout to both the console and the log file, while redirecting stderr to the log file only. The command being intercepted is passed as arguments to the script using the `$@` variable. If the command exits with a status of 0 (success), the script exits with a status of 0. If the command exits with a non-zero status (failure), the script echoes a message to the console indicating that the command failed and instructs the user to check the log file for details. The script then exits with the same non-zero status as the intercepted command. 

If the `$CI` environment variable is not set or `$NO_INTERCEPT` is set, the script simply executes the intercepted command without any redirection or logging. This allows the script to be used outside of a CI environment, such as on a developer's laptop. 

Here is an example of how this script might be used in a CI environment:

```
./intercept.sh npm run test
```

This command intercepts the output of the `npm run test` command and logs it to a file, allowing the CI system to capture and display the output in its build logs. If the test command fails, the script will exit with a non-zero status, causing the CI system to mark the build as failed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   - This script intercepts stderr and stdout and logs them into a file if the environment variable CI is set and NO_INTERCEPT is not set.
2. What is the format of the log file created by this script?
   - The log file created by this script has a name in the format `intercepted-console-YYYYyMMmDDdHHhMMmSSsNNNNNNNNNns.log`, where each letter represents a date/time component.
3. Why is shellcheck disabled in this script?
   - Shellcheck is disabled in this script because the script intentionally allows for a race condition, which would trigger a false positive from shellcheck.
