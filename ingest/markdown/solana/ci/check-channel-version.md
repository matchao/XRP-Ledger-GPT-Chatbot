The `check-channel-version.sh` file is responsible for ensuring that the current channel version is not equal or greater than the version of the latest tag. This is important because it ensures that the latest changes made to the codebase are properly tagged and released before any new changes are made. 

The code first checks if the environment variable `$CI_TAG` is empty. If it is, then the channel version check is performed. If it is not empty, then the script exits without performing any further checks. This is because `$CI_TAG` is set by the CI/CD pipeline when a new tag is created, and the pipeline will handle the release process.

If the check is performed, the script sources the `channel-info.sh` and `read-cargo-variable.sh` scripts to get the latest tag and the current version of the codebase, respectively. It then compares the two values to ensure that the current version is not equal to or greater than the latest tag. If they are equal, an error message is printed, and the script exits with a non-zero status code. 

This script is used as a pre-check before any new changes are made to the codebase. It ensures that the latest changes are properly tagged and released before any new changes are made. This helps to maintain the stability and reliability of the codebase. 

Example usage:
```
$ ./ci/check-channel-version.sh
--- channel version check
latest channel tag: v1.2.3
current version: v1.2.3
Error: A release has been tagged since your feature branch was last rebased. <current version> must be greater than <latest channel tag>..
Possible solutions (in the order they should be tried):
1. rebase your feature branch on the base branch
2. merge the PR: "Bump Version to ..." once it has passed ci/checks, then rebase
3. ask for help in #devops on discord
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
- This script checks if the current channel version is greater than the version of the latest tag.

2. What is the significance of the `CI_TAG` variable?
- The `CI_TAG` variable is used to check if the script is running in a CI environment and if a tag has been set.

3. What are the possible solutions if the current version is not greater than the latest channel tag?
- The possible solutions are: 1) rebase the feature branch on the base branch, 2) merge the PR "Bump Version to..." once it has passed ci/checks, then rebase, or 3) ask for help in #devops on discord.
