The `hoover.sh` script is a Bash script that performs regular maintenance on a Buildkite agent to control disk usage. The script performs several tasks to clean up disk space, including deleting exited containers, untagged images, and dangling images. It also removes unused Docker networks and deletes temporary files older than one day owned by the current user. Finally, the script deletes stale Buildkite agent build directories.

The purpose of this script is to ensure that the Buildkite agent has enough disk space to run builds. By regularly cleaning up unused Docker containers, images, and networks, as well as temporary files and stale build directories, the script helps prevent disk space from running out and causing build failures.

Here is a breakdown of what each section of the script does:

- Delete all exited containers first: This section uses the `docker ps` command to list all exited containers and the `docker rm` command to remove them.
- Delete untagged images: This section uses the `docker images` command to list all images with no tag and the `docker rmi` command to remove them.
- Delete all dangling images: This section uses the `docker images` command with the `--filter` option to list all dangling images and the `docker rmi` command to remove them.
- Remove unused docker networks: This section uses the `docker network prune` command to remove all unused Docker networks.
- Delete /tmp files older than 1 day owned by $(id -un): This section uses the `find` command to locate all temporary files in the `/tmp` directory owned by the current user and older than one day, and the `xargs` command to remove them.
- Deleting stale buildkite agent build directories: This section removes all build directories in the parent directory of the current directory, except for the directories with names matching the pipeline slug, organization slug, and agent name.
- System Status: This section prints the status of the system, including Docker images, running containers, Docker networks, and disk usage.

Overall, the `hoover.sh` script is an important part of the Solana project's Buildkite agent infrastructure, helping to ensure that the agents have enough disk space to run builds. The script can be run manually or scheduled to run regularly as a cron job.
