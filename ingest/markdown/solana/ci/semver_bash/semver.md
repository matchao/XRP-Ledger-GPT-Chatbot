The `semver.sh` file contains a set of functions that allow for parsing and comparison of semantic version strings. Semantic versioning is a widely used standard for versioning software, where each version is represented by three numbers separated by dots, e.g. `1.2.3`. The three numbers represent the major, minor, and patch versions of the software, respectively. The functions in this file allow for parsing these three numbers, as well as an optional "special" string that can be appended to the version number.

The `semverParseInto` function takes a version string as its first argument, and four variable names as its subsequent arguments. It uses a regular expression to extract the major, minor, patch, and special components of the version string, and assigns them to the corresponding variables. For example, if the version string is `1.2.3-beta`, the function would set `MAJOR=1`, `MINOR=2`, `PATCH=3`, and `SPECIAL=-beta`.

The `semverEQ`, `semverLT`, and `semverGT` functions are used for comparing two version strings. `semverEQ` returns true (0) if the two versions are equal, and false (1) otherwise. `semverLT` returns true if the first version is less than the second version, and false otherwise. `semverGT` returns true if the first version is greater than the second version, and false otherwise. These functions use the `semverParseInto` function to extract the major, minor, patch, and special components of each version string, and then compare them in order of importance (major, minor, patch, special).

The code at the bottom of the file is an example usage of these functions. It takes two version strings as command line arguments, and then calls each of the comparison functions on them. It then prints the results of each comparison to the console.

Overall, this file provides a simple and lightweight way to parse and compare semantic version strings in shell scripts. It could be used in a larger project to ensure that different components of the project are using compatible versions of software. For example, a build script could use these functions to check that the version of a dependency being used is greater than or equal to a certain version.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script is used to parse and compare semantic version numbers.

2. What is the format of a semantic version number that this script can parse?
    
    The format of a semantic version number that this script can parse is "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-SPECIAL".

3. What is the difference between the `semverLT` and `semverGT` functions?
    
    The `semverLT` function returns true if the first version number is less than the second version number, while the `semverGT` function returns true if the first version number is greater than the second version number.
