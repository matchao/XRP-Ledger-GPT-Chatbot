The `main.rs` file in the `log-analyzer` module of the Solana project contains the implementation of a command-line tool for processing and analyzing network log files. The tool has two subcommands: `iftop` and `analyze`. 

The `iftop` subcommand processes a log file generated by the `iftop` network monitoring tool. The log file is expected to be in JSON format and contain a list of `LogLine` objects. Each `LogLine` object contains information about the network traffic between two IP addresses, including the amount of data transmitted from one address to the other and vice versa. The `iftop` subcommand reads the log file, removes duplicate entries, and maps private IP addresses to public IP addresses based on a list of IP address mappings provided as a JSON string. The subcommand then outputs the processed log file in JSON format.

The `analyze` subcommand compares processed log files generated by the `iftop` subcommand. The subcommand reads all log files in a specified directory, removes duplicate entries, and computes the difference between the latest log entry and the previous log entry for each unique pair of IP addresses. The subcommand outputs the differences between log entries in a human-readable format.

The `LogLine` struct represents a single line in the log file. It contains four fields: `a`, `b`, `a_to_b`, and `b_to_a`. The `a` and `b` fields are strings representing the IP addresses of the sender and receiver, respectively. The `a_to_b` and `b_to_a` fields are strings representing the amount of data transmitted from `a` to `b` and from `b` to `a`, respectively. The `LogLine` struct also provides an implementation of the `Sub` trait, which computes the difference between two `LogLine` objects and returns a human-readable string representation of the difference.

The `IpAddrMapping` struct represents a mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address. It contains two fields: `private` and `public`, which are strings representing the private and public IP addresses, respectively.

The `map_ip_address` function maps a given IP address to a public IP address based on a list of IP address mappings. The function iterates over the list of mappings and replaces the private IP address with the corresponding public IP address if a match is found.

Overall, the `main.rs` file provides a command-line tool for processing and analyzing network log files. The tool can be used to extract useful information from log files generated by the `iftop` network monitoring tool and to compare log files to identify changes in network traffic over time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LogLine` struct and its associated methods?
- The `LogLine` struct represents a line of log data and its associated methods are used to calculate the difference between two log lines and output the result in a formatted string.
2. What is the purpose of the `map_ip_address` function?
- The `map_ip_address` function takes a list of IP address mappings and a target IP address as input, and returns the target IP address with any private IP addresses replaced with their corresponding public IP addresses from the mapping list.
3. What is the purpose of the `analyze_logs` function?
- The `analyze_logs` function reads in log files from a specified directory, compares the log data between pairs of log lines, and outputs the differences between them. It also has an optional flag to list all differences instead of just the non-zero ones.
