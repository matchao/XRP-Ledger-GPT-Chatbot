The `log-analyzer` module in the Solana project provides a command-line tool for processing and analyzing network log files. This tool is particularly useful for extracting information from log files generated by the `iftop` network monitoring tool and comparing log files to identify changes in network traffic over time.

The tool has two subcommands: `iftop` and `analyze`. The `iftop` subcommand processes a log file in JSON format containing a list of `LogLine` objects, which represent network traffic between two IP addresses. It removes duplicate entries and maps private IP addresses to public IP addresses based on a list of IP address mappings provided as a JSON string. The processed log file is then output in JSON format.

For example, to process an `iftop` log file, you would run:

```
log-analyzer iftop --input-log-file input.json --ip-mappings mappings.json --output-log-file output.json
```

The `analyze` subcommand compares processed log files generated by the `iftop` subcommand. It reads all log files in a specified directory, removes duplicate entries, and computes the difference between the latest log entry and the previous log entry for each unique pair of IP addresses. The differences between log entries are output in a human-readable format.

To analyze a directory of processed log files, you would run:

```
log-analyzer analyze --input-directory logs/ --output-file analysis.txt
```

The `LogLine` struct represents a single line in the log file, containing information about the network traffic between two IP addresses. It provides an implementation of the `Sub` trait, which computes the difference between two `LogLine` objects and returns a human-readable string representation of the difference.

The `IpAddrMapping` struct represents a mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address. The `map_ip_address` function maps a given IP address to a public IP address based on a list of IP address mappings.

In summary, the `log-analyzer` module is a useful tool for processing and analyzing network log files in the Solana project. It can help developers identify changes in network traffic over time and extract valuable information from log files generated by the `iftop` network monitoring tool.
