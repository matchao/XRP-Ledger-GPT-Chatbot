The `ops.rs` file in the `solana/zk-token-sdk/src/zk_token_elgamal` directory provides functions for performing arithmetic operations on ElGamal ciphertexts. These operations are essential for the privacy-preserving features of the zk-token, allowing users to perform transactions without revealing the amounts involved.

The file defines the following functions:

1. `add`: Adds two ElGamal ciphertexts. This is useful for combining encrypted values, such as adding a transferred amount to a recipient's balance.
```rust
let result = add(&left_ciphertext, &right_ciphertext);
```

2. `multiply`: Multiplies an ElGamal ciphertext by a scalar. This can be used to scale encrypted values.
```rust
let result = multiply(&scalar, &ciphertext);
```

3. `add_with_lo_hi`: Adds a ciphertext to the sum of two other ciphertexts, where one is multiplied by a constant shift factor. This is useful for handling split values in range proofs.
```rust
let result = add_with_lo_hi(&left_ciphertext, &right_ciphertext_lo, &right_ciphertext_hi);
```

4. `subtract`: Subtracts two ElGamal ciphertexts. This is useful for reducing an encrypted value, such as subtracting a transferred amount from a sender's balance.
```rust
let result = subtract(&left_ciphertext, &right_ciphertext);
```

5. `subtract_with_lo_hi`: Subtracts the sum of two other ciphertexts (with one multiplied by a constant shift factor) from a ciphertext. This is useful for handling split values in range proofs.
```rust
let result = subtract_with_lo_hi(&left_ciphertext, &right_ciphertext_lo, &right_ciphertext_hi);
```

6. `add_to`: Adds a constant amount to an ElGamal ciphertext. This can be used to adjust an encrypted value by a known amount.
```rust
let result = add_to(&ciphertext, amount);
```

7. `subtract_from`: Subtracts a constant amount from an ElGamal ciphertext. This can be used to adjust an encrypted value by a known amount.
```rust
let result = subtract_from(&ciphertext, amount);
```

These functions are used in the larger zk-token project to perform arithmetic operations on encrypted values while preserving privacy.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SHIFT_BITS` constant and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer:** The `SHIFT_BITS` constant is set to 16 and is used in the `add_with_lo_hi` and `subtract_with_lo_hi` functions to shift the `right_ciphertext_hi` by 2^16. This is done to combine the low and high parts of the ciphertext before performing the addition or subtraction operation with th
