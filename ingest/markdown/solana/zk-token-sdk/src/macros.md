The code in `macros.rs` defines several macros that are used to implement the `Add`, `Sub`, and `Mul` traits for different types. These macros are used internally within the `zk-token-sdk` project to define the main implementations of these traits for various types.

The `define_add_variants!`, `define_sub_variants!`, and `define_mul_variants!` macros all take in three arguments: `LHS`, `RHS`, and `Output`. These arguments are used to define the `Add`, `Sub`, and `Mul` traits for the specified types. The resulting implementations of these traits allow for addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations between different types.

For example, the `define_add_variants!` macro defines the `Add` trait for three different cases: when the left-hand side (`LHS`) is a value of type `$lhs`, the right-hand side (`RHS`) is a reference to a value of type `$rhs`, and the output (`Output`) is of type `$out`. Similarly, the `define_sub_variants!` and `define_mul_variants!` macros define the `Sub` and `Mul` traits for the same three cases.

The `impl_from_transcript_error!` macro defines an implementation of the `From` trait for a given type `$sigma_error_type`. This implementation allows for the conversion of a `TranscriptError` into a `ProofVerificationError::Transcript` error, which can then be converted into the specified `$sigma_error_type`.

Overall, these macros are used to simplify the implementation of the `Add`, `Sub`, and `Mul` traits for different types within the `zk-token-sdk` project. By using these macros, the project can avoid duplicating code and ensure consistency across different implementations of these traits. 

Example usage of these macros can be seen in the `zk-token-sdk` project, such as in the `zk-token-sdk/src/proof_system/mod.rs` file where the `define_add_variants!` macro is used to define the `Add` trait for different types used in the proof system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `define_add_variants`, `define_sub_variants`, and `define_mul_variants` macros?
- These macros are used to define the `Add`, `Sub`, and `Mul` traits for different types, allowing them to be added, subtracted, and multiplied together.

2. What is the purpose of the `impl_from_transcript_error` macro?
- This macro is used to implement the `From` trait for a given type, allowing it to be converted from a `TranscriptError` into a specific error type (`$sigma_error_type`).

3. What is the significance of the `#[macro_export]` attribute on the `define_add_variants` macro?
- This attribute indicates that the macro should be made available for use in other crates that depend on this one.
