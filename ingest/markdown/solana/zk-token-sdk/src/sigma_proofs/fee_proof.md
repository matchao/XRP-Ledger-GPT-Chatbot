The `fee_proof.rs` file in the Solana zk-token-sdk project contains the implementation of sigma proofs for transfer fees. The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to prove that a committed fee is either greater than or equal to the maximum fee bound or less than the maximum fee bound, without revealing the actual fee amount. This is achieved using the `FeeSigmaProof` struct, which consists of two main components: `fee_max_proof` and `fee_equality_proof`.

The `FeeSigmaProof` struct provides methods for creating and verifying the proof. The `new` method creates a fee sigma proof by generating proofs for both cases (fee greater than or equal to the maximum fee bound and fee less than the maximum fee bound) and then conditionally selecting the appropriate proof based on the actual fee amount. This is done to enforce constant-time execution and prevent information leakage.

The `verify` method is used to verify a given fee sigma proof. It takes the Pedersen commitments of the transfer fee, the "real" delta value, and the "claimed" delta value, along with the maximum fee bound and a transcript for the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. The method checks if the algebraic relations hold for the given proof and returns an error if they do not.

Here's an example of how the `FeeSigmaProof` can be used:

```rust
let proof = FeeSigmaProof::new(
    (fee_amount, &fee_commitment, &fee_opening),
    (delta, &delta_commitment, &delta_opening),
    (&claimed_commitment, &claimed_opening),
    max_fee,
    &mut prover_transcript,
);

assert!(proof
    .verify(
        &fee_commitment,
        &delta_commitment,
        &claimed_commitment,
        max_fee,
        &mut verifier_transcript,
    )
    .is_ok());
```

In this example, a new `FeeSigmaProof` is created with the given inputs and then verified using the `verify` method. If the verification is successful, the proof is considered valid.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: How is the fee calculated in the `FeeSigmaProof` struct?
   **Answer**: The code currently does not provide details on how the fee is calculated. There is a TODO comment at the beginning of the file indicating that this information should be added later.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `conditional_select_ristretto` function?
   **Answer**: The `conditional_select_ristretto` function is used to conditionally select one of the two given `CompressedRistretto` values based on the provided `Choice`. This is useful for constant-time operations in the implementation of the `FeeSigmaProof`.

3. **Question**: How does the `FeeSigmaProof::new` function handle the case when the committed fee is greater than the maximum fee bound?
   **Answer**: The `FeeSigmaProof::new` function generates two proofs, one for the case when the committed fee is greater than the maximum fee bound (`proof_fee_above_max`) and another for the case when the committed fee is less than the maximum fee bound (`proof_fee_below_max`). It then conditionally selects the appropriate proof based on whether the fee amount surpasses the max fee using the `conditional_select` method.
