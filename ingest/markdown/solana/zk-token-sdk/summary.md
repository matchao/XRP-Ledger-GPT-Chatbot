The `zk-token-sdk` module in the Solana project provides cryptographic primitives and proof systems for secure and private transactions on the Solana blockchain. It includes implementations of various encryption schemes, elliptic curve operations, and zero-knowledge proof systems, such as range proofs and sigma proofs.

For example, the `range_proof` module enables the creation and verification of range proofs for confidential transactions in a zero-knowledge setting. Developers can use these proofs to ensure that a committed value lies within a specific range without revealing the actual value.

```rust
use solana_zk_token_sdk::range_proof::RangeProof;

let (comm, open) = Pedersen::new(55_u64);
let mut transcript_create = Transcript::new(b"Test");
let mut transcript_verify = Transcript::new(b"Test");
let proof = RangeProof::new(vec![55], vec![32], vec![&open], &mut transcript_create);
assert!(proof.verify(vec![&comm], vec![32], &mut transcript_verify).is_ok());
```

The `sigma_proofs` module provides implementations of various sigma proofs used in the zk-token protocol. These proofs work on Pedersen commitments and twisted ElGamal ciphertexts, ensuring the security and privacy of the zk-token protocol.

```rust
use solana_zk_token_sdk::sigma_proofs::validity_proof::ValidityProof;

let sender_pk = sender_public_key;
let recipient_pk = recipient_public_key;
let amount = 100;
let ciphertext = create_twisted_elgamal_ciphertext(amount, recipient_pk);
let validity_proof = ValidityProof::new(&ciphertext, &sender_pk, &recipient_pk);
assert!(validity_proof.verify(&ciphertext));
```

The `curve25519` module provides a set of functions and traits for performing cryptographic operations using the Curve25519 elliptic curve algorithm. Developers can use these operations for key generation, signing, and verification.

```rust
use solana_zk_token_sdk::curve25519::curve_syscall_traits::{GroupOperations, CURVE25519_EDWARDS};

let p1 = ...;
let p2 = ...;
let curve_ops = CURVE25519_EDWARDS.curve_ops();
let result = curve_ops.add(&p1, &p2);
```

The `encryption` folder offers tools for encryption, decryption, arithmetic operations, and serialization/deserialization of data structures related to ElGamal encryption, which is used in the zk-token protocol.

```rust
use solana_zkutil::pedersen::{PedersenCommitment, PedersenParameters};
use curve25519_dalek::ristretto::RistrettoPoint;

let params = PedersenParameters::new();
let value = 42u64;
let commitment = PedersenCommitment::create_commitment(value, &params);
let RistrettoPoint(commitment_bytes) = commitment.commitment();
println!("Pedersen commitment: {:?}", commitment_bytes);
```

Overall, the `zk-token-sdk` module plays a critical role in enabling secure and private token transfers on the Solana blockchain. Its methods can be used by developers to generate zero-knowledge proofs for their own applications.
