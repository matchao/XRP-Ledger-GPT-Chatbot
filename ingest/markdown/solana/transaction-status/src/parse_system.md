The `parse_system` function in the `solana/transaction-status/src/parse_system.rs` file is responsible for parsing system instructions in the Solana blockchain. It takes a `CompiledInstruction` and `AccountKeys` as input and returns a `Result` containing a `ParsedInstructionEnum` or a `ParseInstructionError`.

The function first deserializes the instruction data into a `SystemInstruction` enum. It then checks if the maximum account index in the instruction is within the bounds of the account keys. If not, it returns an error.

Next, the function matches the `SystemInstruction` enum variant and processes each case accordingly. For each case, it checks the number of accounts involved in the instruction and constructs a `ParsedInstructionEnum` containing the instruction type and relevant information in JSON format. The information includes details such as source and destination accounts, lamports, space, owner, seed, and other relevant fields depending on the instruction type.

Some of the supported instruction types include:

- `createAccount`: Creates a new account with the specified lamports, space, and owner.
- `assign`: Assigns an owner to an account.
- `transfer`: Transfers lamports between two accounts.
- `createAccountWithSeed`: Creates a new account with a seed, lamports, space, and owner.
- `allocate`: Allocates space for an account.
- `allocateWithSeed`: Allocates space for an account with a seed and owner.
- `assignWithSeed`: Assigns an owner to an account with a seed.
- `transferWithSeed`: Transfers lamports between two accounts with a seed and owner.

The parsed instructions are used in the larger Solana project to process and validate transactions, as well as to provide human-readable information about the transactions.

For example, to parse a `transfer` instruction:

```rust
let lamports = 55;
let from_pubkey = Pubkey::new_unique();
let to_pubkey = Pubkey::new_unique();
let instruction = system_instruction::transfer(&from_pubkey, &to_pubkey, lamports);
let mut message = Message::new(&[instruction], None);
let parsed_instruction = parse_system(
    &message.instructions[0],
    &AccountKeys::new(&message.account_keys, None)
).unwrap();
assert_eq!(
    parsed_instruction,
    ParsedInstructionEnum {
        instruction_type: "transfer".to_string(),
        info: json!({
            "source": from_pubkey.to_string(),
            "destination": to_pubkey.to_string(),
            "lamports": lamports,
        }),
    }
);
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `parse_system` function and what are its input parameters?
   **Answer**: The `parse_system` function is responsible for parsing a given system instruction and returning a `ParsedInstructionEnum` containing the instruction type and relevant information. It takes two input parameters: a reference to a `CompiledInstruction` and a reference to `AccountKeys`.

2. **Question**: How does the `parse_system` function handle different types of `SystemInstruction`?
   **Answer**: The `parse_system` function uses a match statement to handle different types of `SystemInstruction`. For each variant of `SystemInstruction`, it constructs a corresponding `ParsedInstructionEnum` with the appropriate instruction type and information.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `check_num_system_accounts` function and how is it used in the `parse_system` function?
   **Answer**: The `check_num_system_accounts` function is a helper function that checks if the number of accounts in the given instruction matches the expected number for a specific system instruction. It is used in the `parse_system` function to validate the number of accounts for each type of `SystemInstruction` before parsing it.
