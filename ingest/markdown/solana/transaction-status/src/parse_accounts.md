The `parse_accounts.rs` file contains two functions, `parse_legacy_message_accounts` and `parse_v0_message_accounts`, that parse the accounts associated with a given message. The `ParsedAccount` struct represents an account and contains the account's public key, whether it is writable, whether it is a signer, and the source of the account (either `Transaction` or `LookupTable`). The `ParsedAccountSource` enum represents the source of an account.

The `parse_legacy_message_accounts` function takes a `Message` object as input and returns a vector of `ParsedAccount` objects. It iterates through the account keys in the message and creates a `ParsedAccount` object for each account. The `writable` and `signer` fields of the `ParsedAccount` object are set based on the corresponding methods in the `Message` object. The `source` field is set to `Transaction` for all accounts.

The `parse_v0_message_accounts` function takes a `LoadedMessage` object as input and returns a vector of `ParsedAccount` objects. It iterates through the account keys in the message and creates a `ParsedAccount` object for each account. The `writable` and `signer` fields of the `ParsedAccount` object are set based on the corresponding methods in the `LoadedMessage` object. The `source` field is set to `Transaction` for accounts that have an index less than the length of the static account keys in the `LoadedMessage` object, and `LookupTable` for all other accounts.

These functions are used to parse the accounts associated with a message in the Solana blockchain. The `ParsedAccount` objects can be used to determine the properties of each account, such as whether it is writable or a signer. This information can be used to validate transactions and ensure that they are executed correctly. The `ParsedAccountSource` enum can be used to determine the source of each account, which can be useful for debugging and tracing transactions. 

Example usage:

```
use solana_sdk::message::{v0::LoadedMessage, Message};
use solana_transaction_status::parse_accounts::{parse_legacy_message_accounts, parse_v0_message_accounts};

let message = Message::default();
let parsed_accounts = parse_legacy_message_accounts(&message);
println!("{:?}", parsed_accounts);

let loaded_message = LoadedMessage::default();
let parsed_accounts = parse_v0_message_accounts(&loaded_message);
println!("{:?}", parsed_accounts);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ParsedAccount` struct and what information does it contain?
- The `ParsedAccount` struct contains information about an account, including its public key, whether it is writable, whether it is a signer, and its source (either `Transaction` or `LookupTable`).
2. What is the difference between `parse_legacy_message_accounts` and `parse_v0_message_accounts` functions?
- `parse_legacy_message_accounts` takes a `Message` object as input and returns a vector of `ParsedAccount` objects, while `parse_v0_message_accounts` takes a `LoadedMessage` object as input and returns a vector of `ParsedAccount` objects. The former is used for messages with version 0, while the latter is used for messages with version 1 or higher.
3. What is the purpose of the `ParsedAccountSource` enum and how is it used in the code?
- The `ParsedAccountSource` enum is used to indicate whether an account was included in the transaction itself (`Transaction`) or in the lookup table (`LookupTable`). It is used in both the `ParsedAccount` struct and the `parse_v0_message_accounts` function to set the `source` field of each `ParsedAccount` object.
