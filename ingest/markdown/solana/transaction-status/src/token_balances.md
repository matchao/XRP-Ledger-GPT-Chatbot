The `token_balances.rs` file in the `solana/transaction-status/src` directory contains code that defines a `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` struct and a `TransactionTokenBalances` type alias. The purpose of this code is to represent the token balances of a transaction before and after it is executed.

The `TransactionTokenBalances` type alias is defined as a vector of vectors of `TransactionTokenBalance` structs. Each inner vector represents the token balances of a single account, and each `TransactionTokenBalance` struct contains information about a specific token, including its mint address, account address, and balance.

The `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` struct contains two fields: `pre_token_balances` and `post_token_balances`. These fields are both of type `TransactionTokenBalances` and represent the token balances of a transaction before and after it is executed, respectively.

The `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` struct also has a `new` method that takes two arguments: `pre_token_balances` and `post_token_balances`. This method creates a new `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` instance and initializes its fields with the provided values. It also checks that the lengths of the two input vectors are equal using the `assert_eq!` macro.

This code is likely used in the larger Solana project to track the changes in token balances that occur as a result of executing transactions. For example, it could be used by a wallet application to display the updated token balances of a user's accounts after they have sent or received tokens. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```rust
use solana_transaction_status::token_balances::{TransactionTokenBalances, TransactionTokenBalancesSet};

// Create some example token balances
let pre_token_balances = vec![
    vec![
        TransactionTokenBalance {
            mint: "mint1".to_string(),
            account: "account1".to_string(),
            balance: 100,
        },
        TransactionTokenBalance {
            mint: "mint2".to_string(),
            account: "account1".to_string(),
            balance: 200,
        },
    ],
    vec![
        TransactionTokenBalance {
            mint: "mint1".to_string(),
            account: "account2".to_string(),
            balance: 50,
        },
    ],
];
let post_token_balances = vec![
    vec![
        TransactionTokenBalance {
            mint: "mint1".to_string(),
            account: "account1".to_string(),
            balance: 50,
        },
        TransactionTokenBalance {
            mint: "mint2".to_string(),
            account: "account1".to_string(),
            balance: 300,
        },
    ],
    vec![
        TransactionTokenBalance {
            mint: "mint1".to_string(),
            account: "account2".to_string(),
            balance: 100,
        },
    ],
];

// Create a new TransactionTokenBalancesSet instance
let token_balances_set = TransactionTokenBalancesSet::new(pre_token_balances, post_token_balances);

// Access the pre- and post-transaction token balances
let pre_token_balances = &token_balances_set.pre_token_balances;
let post_token_balances = &token_balances_set.post_token_balances;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionTokenBalances` type and how is it used in this code?
   - The `TransactionTokenBalances` type is a vector of vectors of `TransactionTokenBalance` structs, representing the token balances of a transaction before and after execution. It is used as the type for the `pre_token_balances` and `post_token_balances` fields of the `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` struct.

2. What is the significance of the `assert_eq!(pre_token_balances.len(), post_token_balances.len())` line in the `new` function?
   - This line ensures that the `pre_token_balances` and `post_token_balances` vectors have the same length, which is necessary for them to be paired correctly. If the lengths are not equal, an assertion error will be triggered.

3. What is the purpose of the `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` struct and how is it used in the larger solana project?
   - The `TransactionTokenBalancesSet` struct represents the token balances of a transaction before and after execution, and is used in various places throughout the solana project to track changes in token balances. For example, it is used in the `TransactionStatusMeta` struct to provide additional information about a transaction's status.
