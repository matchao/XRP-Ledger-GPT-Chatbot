The `parse_address_lookup_table.rs` file is responsible for parsing instructions related to the address lookup table in the Solana project. The address lookup table is a data structure that stores mappings between addresses and their associated data. This file provides a function `parse_address_lookup_table` that takes a `CompiledInstruction` and `AccountKeys` as input and returns a `ParsedInstructionEnum` as output.

The `parse_address_lookup_table` function first deserializes the instruction data into a `ProgramInstruction` enum. It then checks if the maximum account index in the instruction is within the bounds of the account keys. If not, it returns an error. Next, it matches the `ProgramInstruction` enum to one of the following variants: `CreateLookupTable`, `FreezeLookupTable`, `ExtendLookupTable`, `DeactivateLookupTable`, or `CloseLookupTable`. For each variant, it checks the number of accounts in the instruction and constructs a `ParsedInstructionEnum` with the appropriate instruction type and information.

For example, when parsing a `CreateLookupTable` instruction, the function checks if there are 4 accounts in the instruction. If so, it constructs a `ParsedInstructionEnum` with the instruction type set to "createLookupTable" and a JSON object containing information about the lookup table account, lookup table authority, payer account, system program, recent slot, and bump seed.

The file also includes a helper function `check_num_address_lookup_table_accounts` that checks if the number of accounts in the instruction matches the expected number for a given `ParsableProgram`.

Finally, the file contains a test module with unit tests for each instruction type, ensuring that the parsing functions work correctly for valid and invalid inputs.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `parse_address_lookup_table` function?
   **Answer**: The `parse_address_lookup_table` function is responsible for parsing a given `CompiledInstruction` and `AccountKeys` and returning a `ParsedInstructionEnum` that represents the parsed instruction with its associated data.

2. **Question**: How does the function handle different `ProgramInstruction` variants?
   **Answer**: The function uses a match statement to handle different `ProgramInstruction` variants, such as `CreateLookupTable`, `FreezeLookupTable`, `ExtendLookupTable`, `DeactivateLookupTable`, and `CloseLookupTable`. For each variant, it checks the number of accounts and constructs the corresponding `ParsedInstructionEnum` with the appropriate instruction type and information.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `check_num_address_lookup_table_accounts` function?
   **Answer**: The `check_num_address_lookup_table_accounts` function is a helper function that checks if the number of accounts in the given `accounts` slice matches the expected number `num` for the `ParsableProgram::AddressLookupTable`. If the number of accounts does not match, it returns a `ParseInstructionError`.
