The `discard.rs` file in the `perf` module of the Solana project contains a function called `discard_batches_randomly`. This function takes in a mutable vector of `PacketBatch` objects, a maximum number of packets, and a total number of packets. It returns the new total number of packets after discarding any excess batches randomly.

The purpose of this function is to discard batches of packets randomly until the total number of packets is less than or equal to the maximum number of packets specified. This is useful in scenarios where there is a limit on the number of packets that can be processed at once, such as in network communication or data transfer.

The function achieves this by using a while loop to iterate over the batches until the total number of packets is less than or equal to the maximum number of packets. Within the loop, it generates a random index using the `thread_rng` function from the `rand` crate and removes the batch at that index using the `swap_remove` method. It then subtracts the length of the removed batch from the total number of packets using the `saturating_sub` method to ensure that the total number of packets does not become negative.

The `discard_batches_randomly` function is used in the larger Solana project to optimize network communication and data transfer by limiting the number of packets that are processed at once. It can be called from other modules or functions that deal with packet batches to ensure that the number of packets being processed does not exceed a certain limit.

Here is an example of how the `discard_batches_randomly` function can be used:

```
let mut batches = vec![PacketBatch::default(); 10];
let max_packets = 20;
let total_packets = batches.iter().map(|batch| batch.len()).sum();
let new_total_packets = discard_batches_randomly(&mut batches, max_packets, total_packets);
println!("New total number of packets: {}", new_total_packets);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   - This code defines a function called `discard_batches_randomly` that takes a mutable vector of `PacketBatch` objects, a maximum number of packets, and a total number of packets as input. It removes batches randomly from the vector until the total number of packets is less than or equal to the maximum number of packets, and returns the new total number of packets.
2. What is the purpose of the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute and the `test_batch_discard_random` function?
   - The `#[cfg(test)]` attribute indicates that the following module contains unit tests that should only be compiled when running tests. The `test_batch_discard_random` function is a unit test that checks whether the `discard_batches_randomly` function correctly discards batches until the maximum number of packets is reached.
3. What is the significance of the `saturating_sub` method?
   - The `saturating_sub` method subtracts the length of a removed batch from the total number of packets, but returns 0 if the result would be negative. This ensures that the total number of packets is always non-negative and prevents integer underflow.
