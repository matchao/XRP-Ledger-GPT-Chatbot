The `solana/perf/src/deduper.rs` file provides a utility to deduplicate batches of incoming network packets. The main structure in this file is `Deduper`, which is a probabilistic data structure that helps in identifying and removing duplicate packets efficiently. It uses a Bloom filter-like approach with multiple hash functions to achieve this.

`Deduper` is initialized with a specified false positive rate and number of bits. It also has a capacity, which is the maximum number of one bits before the false positive rate exceeds the specified threshold. The `new` function creates a new `Deduper` instance with the given parameters.

The `maybe_reset` function is used to reset the `Deduper` if the current number of one bits (popcount) exceeds the capacity or if the elapsed time since the last reset is greater than the specified reset cycle duration.

The main functionality of this utility is provided by the `dedup_packet` function, which takes a reference to a `Packet` and returns true if the packet is a duplicate. It does this by hashing the packet data with multiple hash functions (seeds) and checking if the corresponding bits in the filter are set. If all bits are set, the packet is considered a duplicate.

The `dedup_packets_and_count_discards` function is used to deduplicate packets in a batch and count the number of discarded packets. It takes a mutable reference to an array of `PacketBatch` and a closure to process the received packets. It iterates through the packets, checks if they are duplicates using `dedup_packet`, and processes them accordingly.

The tests in this file cover various scenarios, such as deduplicating the same packets, different packets, saturated filters, and false positives. They also test the capacity calculation and seeded behavior of the `Deduper`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Deduper` struct and how does it work?
   **Answer:** The `Deduper` struct is a utility to deduplicate batches of incoming network packets. It uses a probabilistic data structure (Bloom filter) to efficiently check for duplicates and remove them, while maintaining a specified false positive rate.

2. **Question:** How does the `maybe_reset` function work and when should it be called?
   **Answer:** The `maybe_reset` function resets the internal state of the `Deduper` if the number of one bits in the filter exceeds the specified capacity or if the elapsed time since the last reset is greater than or equal to the provided `reset_cycle` duration. This function should be called periodically to ensure the deduplication process remains efficient and accurate.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `dedup_packets_and_count_discards` function and how does it handle duplicates?
   **Answer:** The `dedup_packets_and_count_discards` function processes a mutable slice of `PacketBatch` and deduplicates the packets within. It takes a closure `process_received_packet` to handle the packets based on their deduplication status. If a packet is a duplicate, it sets the `discard` flag in the packet's metadata and calls the closure with the appropriate parameters. The function returns the total number of discarded packets.
