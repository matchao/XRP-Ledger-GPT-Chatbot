The `solana/download-utils/src/lib.rs` file provides utilities for downloading files, such as genesis and snapshot archives, from a remote server. These utilities are used in the Solana project to fetch necessary files for setting up and maintaining a node.

The main functions provided in this file are:

- `download_file`: Downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a specified destination path. It also supports displaying a progress bar and invoking a callback function to report download progress.
- `download_genesis_if_missing`: Downloads the genesis archive from a specified RPC address if it doesn't already exist in the given path. It returns the path to the downloaded file or an error if the genesis archive already exists.
- `download_snapshot_archive`: Downloads a snapshot archive (either full or incremental) from a specified RPC address and saves it to the appropriate directory. It also purges old snapshot archives based on the provided retention limits.

These functions use the `DownloadProgressRecord` struct to model the download progress, which includes information such as elapsed time, throughput, total bytes, and estimated remaining time. The `DownloadProgressCallback` type is used to define a callback function that can be invoked with the progress record during the download process.

Here's an example of how to use the `download_file` function:

```rust
let url = "https://example.com/file.txt";
let destination_path = Path::new("/path/to/save/file.txt");
let use_progress_bar = true;
let mut progress_callback: DownloadProgressCallbackOption = None;

download_file(url, &destination_path, use_progress_bar, &mut progress_callback)
    .expect("Failed to download file");
```

And an example of using the `download_genesis_if_missing` function:

```rust
let rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:8899".parse().unwrap();
let genesis_package = Path::new("/path/to/genesis");
let use_progress_bar = true;

download_genesis_if_missing(&rpc_addr, &genesis_package, use_progress_bar)
    .expect("Failed to download genesis");
```

These utilities are helpful for developers working with the Solana project, as they simplify the process of downloading and managing necessary files for running a node.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `download_file` function and how does it handle progress notifications?
   
   **Answer:** The `download_file` function is responsible for downloading a file from a given URL and saving it to a specified destination path. It also provides an optional progress notification callback, which allows the caller to get notified of the download progress modeled by the `DownloadProgressRecord` structure. The callback can return `true` to continue the download or `false` to abort the download.

2. **Question:** How does the `download_genesis_if_missing` function work and when does it download the genesis package?

   **Answer:** The `download_genesis_if_missing` function checks if the genesis package already exists at the specified path. If it does not exist, it downloads the genesis package from the given `rpc_addr` and saves it to a temporary path. The function returns the temporary path of the downloaded genesis package if the download was successful, otherwise, it returns an error indicating that the genesis package already exists.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `download_snapshot_archive` function and how does it handle different archive formats?

   **Answer:** The `download_snapshot_archive` function is responsible for downloading a snapshot archive from a given `rpc_addr`. It takes into account the specified snapshot type (full or incremental) and tries to download the snapshot archive in different archive formats (TarZstd, TarGzip, TarBzip2, TarLz4, and Tar). The function iterates through the available archive formats and attempts to download the snapshot archive for each format. If the download is successful for any format, the function returns `Ok(())`, otherwise, it returns an error indicating that the download failed for all formats.
