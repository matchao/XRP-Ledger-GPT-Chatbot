The `input_parsers.rs` file in the `solana/clap-utils` module provides utility functions for parsing command-line arguments and converting them into appropriate data types. These functions are used by the Solana CLI tools to process user inputs and perform various operations.

The utility functions can be categorized into the following groups:

1. **Value parsing**: Functions like `values_of` and `value_of` are used to parse values of specific types from the command-line arguments. For example, `value_of` can be used to parse an integer value from the arguments:

   ```rust
   let matches = app().get_matches_from(vec!["test", "--single", "50"]);
   assert_eq!(value_of(&matches, "single"), Some(50));
   ```

2. **Keypair and pubkey parsing**: Functions like `keypair_of`, `pubkey_of`, `keypairs_of`, and `pubkeys_of` are used to parse keypairs and public keys from the command-line arguments. These functions can handle both direct public key inputs and keypair files. For example, `pubkey_of` can be used to parse a public key from a keypair file:

   ```rust
   let matches = app().get_matches_from(vec!["test", "--single", &keypair_file]);
   assert_eq!(pubkey_of(&matches, "single"), Some(pubkey));
   ```

3. **Signer parsing**: Functions like `signer_of`, `pubkey_of_signer`, and `pubkeys_of_multiple_signers` are used to parse signers and their public keys from the command-line arguments. These functions can handle different signer types, such as hardware wallets and keypair files.

4. **Other parsing utilities**: Functions like `unix_timestamp_from_rfc3339_datetime`, `lamports_of_sol`, `cluster_type_of`, and `commitment_of` are used to parse various other data types from the command-line arguments, such as timestamps, lamports, cluster types, and commitment configurations.

These utility functions make it easier for the Solana CLI tools to process user inputs and perform the required operations.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `STDOUT_OUTFILE_TOKEN` constant?
   **Answer**: The `STDOUT_OUTFILE_TOKEN` constant is a sentinel value used to indicate that the output should be written to the screen (standard output) instead of a file.

2. **Question**: How does the `pubkeys_sigs_of` function work and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `pubkeys_sigs_of` function takes the command line argument matches and a name, and returns an `Option<Vec<(Pubkey, Signature)>>`. It parses the values of the specified argument as strings in the format "pubkey=signature" and returns a vector of tuples containing the parsed `Pubkey` and `Signature` pairs.

3. **Question**: How does the `resolve_signer` function handle remote wallet signers?
   **Answer**: The `resolve_signer` function uses the `resolve_signer_from_path` function to handle remote wallet signers. It takes the command line argument matches, a name, and a mutable reference to a `RemoteWalletManager` wrapped in an `Option`. If a remote wallet signer is specified in the argument, the function will resolve the signer using the provided `RemoteWalletManager`.
