The `banks_server.rs` file defines the `BanksServer` struct and its associated methods, which are responsible for handling and processing transactions in the Solana project. The `BanksServer` struct contains fields such as `bank_forks`, `block_commitment_cache`, `transaction_sender`, and `poll_signature_status_sleep_duration`.

The `BanksServer` struct implements several methods, including:

- `new`: Creates a new instance of `BanksServer` with the given parameters.
- `run`: Processes transactions received from the `transaction_receiver` channel and tries to process them using the working bank.
- `new_loopback`: Creates a new loopback instance of `BanksServer` for unit testing purposes.
- `slot`: Returns the slot for the given commitment level.
- `bank`: Returns the bank for the given commitment level.
- `poll_signature_status`: Polls the signature status of a transaction until it's found or the last valid block height is reached.

The `BanksServer` struct also implements the `Banks` trait, which defines several async methods for processing and simulating transactions, getting account information, and fetching blockhashes and fees. Some of these methods include `send_transaction_with_context`, `get_fees_with_commitment_and_context`, `get_transaction_status_with_context`, `process_transaction_with_preflight_and_commitment_and_context`, and `simulate_transaction_with_commitment_and_context`.

The `start_local_server` function is used to start a local server for testing purposes, while the `start_tcp_server` function starts a TCP server that listens for incoming connections and processes transactions.

Here's an example of how to create a new `BanksServer` instance:

```rust
let banks_server = BanksServer::new(
    bank_forks,
    block_commitment_cache,
    transaction_sender,
    poll_signature_status_sleep_duration,
);
```

And here's an example of how to start a local server for testing:

```rust
let local_server = start_local_server(
    bank_forks,
    block_commitment_cache,
    poll_signature_status_sleep_duration,
).await;
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `BanksServer` struct and its associated methods?
   
   **Answer**: The `BanksServer` struct represents a server that handles various banking-related operations, such as sending transactions, getting transaction status, simulating transactions, and processing transactions. It provides methods to interact with the underlying `BankForks` and `BlockCommitmentCache` data structures and manages transaction processing through a sender-receiver channel.

2. **Question**: How does the `start_local_server` function differ from the `start_tcp_server` function?

   **Answer**: The `start_local_server` function creates a loopback server for unit-testing purposes, while the `start_tcp_server` function starts a TCP server that listens for incoming connections on a specified address. The loopback server uses an in-memory channel for communication, whereas the TCP server uses a TCP-based transport for communication.

3. **Question**: What is the role of the `poll_signature_status` method in the `BanksServer` struct?

   **Answer**: The `poll_signature_status` method is responsible for polling the signature status of a transaction until it is either confirmed or the bank's block height exceeds the last valid block height. It takes a signature, blockhash, last valid block height, and commitment level as input and returns an `Option<transaction::Result<()>>` indicating the transaction's status.
