The `args.rs` file in the `solana/stake-accounts` module defines the data structures and functions for handling command-line arguments related to stake accounts management. It provides a way to parse and resolve command-line arguments for various stake account operations, such as creating new stake accounts, querying account information, authorizing new authorities, setting lockup conditions, rebasing, and moving stake accounts.

The file defines several data structures, including `NewArgs`, `CountArgs`, `QueryArgs`, `AuthorizeArgs`, `SetLockupArgs`, `RebaseArgs`, `MoveArgs`, and `Command`. These structures represent the different types of command-line arguments that can be passed to the stake accounts management tool. The `Args` structure contains the configuration file, URL, and the command to be executed.

The file also provides several functions to resolve the command-line arguments into their corresponding data structures. These functions include `resolve_stake_authority`, `resolve_withdraw_authority`, `resolve_new_stake_authority`, `resolve_new_withdraw_authority`, `resolve_fee_payer`, `resolve_custodian`, `resolve_new_custodian`, `resolve_base_pubkey`, and `resolve_new_base_keypair`. Each of these functions takes a string input and returns the corresponding `Signer` or `Pubkey` object.

The main function, `resolve_command`, takes a `Command` object and resolves its arguments using the appropriate resolver functions. It returns a new `Command` object with the resolved arguments. This function is used by the stake accounts management tool to parse and execute the command-line arguments.

For example, if a user wants to create a new stake account, they would pass the required arguments to the command-line tool. The `resolve_command` function would then parse these arguments and create a `NewArgs` object with the resolved arguments. This object would then be used by the stake accounts management tool to create the new stake account.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `resolve_*` functions in this code?**

   The `resolve_*` functions are used to resolve the input arguments (such as keypairs, pubkeys, and authorities) from their string representations to their actual types, like `Pubkey` and `Box<dyn Signer>`. These functions utilize the `wallet_manager` to handle remote wallets and key management.

2. **How does the `resolve_command` function work and what is its role?**

   The `resolve_command` function takes a reference to a `Command` enum with generic `String` types for its fields and resolves the input arguments using the appropriate `resolve_*` functions. It then returns a new `Command` enum with the resolved types (`Pubkey` and `Box<dyn Signer>`). This function is used to process and validate the input arguments before executing the actual command.

3. **What is the purpose of the `NewArgs`, `CountArgs`, `QueryArgs`, `AuthorizeArgs`, `SetLockupArgs`, `RebaseArgs`, and `MoveArgs` structs?**

   These structs represent the different types of arguments required for each command in the `Command` enum. They store the necessary information for each command, such as keypairs, pubkeys, authorities, and other relevant data. By having separate structs for each command, the code is more modular and easier to understand.
