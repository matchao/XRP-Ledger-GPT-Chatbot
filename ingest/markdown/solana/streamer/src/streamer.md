The `streamer` module provides a set of services for efficiently receiving and sending data from/to UDP sockets. It is designed to handle high-throughput data streams in the Solana project.

The `StakedNodes` struct holds information about the total stake, maximum and minimum stake, and maps of IP addresses and public keys to their respective stakes. This information is used to manage the distribution of data across the network.

The `PacketBatchReceiver` and `PacketBatchSender` types are aliases for crossbeam channels, which are used for efficient communication between threads. The `StreamerError` enum defines various errors that can occur while streaming data.

The `StreamerReceiveStats` struct holds statistics related to received packets, such as the number of packets, packet batches, full packet batches, and the maximum channel length. The `report` method is used to log these statistics.

The `recv_loop` function is the core of the receiver service. It continuously receives packets from a UDP socket and sends them as a batch to the `PacketBatchSender`. It also updates the `StreamerReceiveStats` with the latest statistics.

The `receiver` function creates a new thread that runs the `recv_loop` function. It takes a UDP socket, an exit signal, a `PacketBatchSender`, a `PacketBatchRecycler`, and other parameters as input.

The `responder` function creates a new thread that runs the `recv_send` function. It takes a name, a UDP socket, a `PacketBatchReceiver`, a `SocketAddrSpace`, and an optional `stats_reporter_sender` as input. The `recv_send` function receives packet batches from the `PacketBatchReceiver`, filters them based on the `SocketAddrSpace`, and sends them using the provided UDP socket.

The `recv_packet_batches` and `recv_vec_packet_batches` functions are utility functions that receive packet batches from a `PacketBatchReceiver` and return them as a tuple containing the received packet batches, the total number of packets, and the duration of the receive operation.

In summary, the `streamer` module provides efficient and high-throughput data streaming services for the Solana project. It handles receiving and sending data from/to UDP sockets, manages staked nodes, and maintains statistics for monitoring the performance of the streaming services.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `StakedNodes` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `StakedNodes` struct is used to store information about the total stake, maximum stake, minimum stake, and stake maps for IP addresses and public keys. It is not directly used in the code provided, but it is likely used elsewhere in the project to manage and track staking information for nodes.

2. **Question**: How does the `recv_loop` function handle the case when the node is in "vote only" mode?
   **Answer**: In the `recv_loop` function, if the `in_vote_only_mode` option is set, it checks the value of the `AtomicBool` it contains. If it is set to `true`, the function sleeps for 1 millisecond and then continues to the next iteration of the loop, effectively skipping the packet processing for that iteration.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `StreamerSendStats` struct and how is it used in the `responder` function?
   **Answer**: The `StreamerSendStats` struct is used to collect and report statistics about the sent packets, such as the number of bytes sent, the number of packets sent, and the distribution of sent bytes across different hosts. In the `responder` function, if the `stats_reporter_sender` option is set, a `StreamerSendStats` instance is created and used to record packet statistics. The statistics are then reported periodically based on a specified duration or when the host map reaches a certain size.
