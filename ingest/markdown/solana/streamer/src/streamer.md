The `streamer` module provides a set of services for efficiently receiving and sending data from/to UDP sockets. It is designed to handle high-throughput data streams in the Solana project.

The `StakedNodes` struct holds information about the total stake, maximum and minimum stake, and maps of IP addresses and public keys to their respective stakes. This information is used to manage the distribution of data across the network.

The `PacketBatchReceiver` and `PacketBatchSender` types are aliases for crossbeam channels, which are used for efficient communication between threads. The `StreamerError` enum defines various errors that can occur while streaming data.

The `StreamerReceiveStats` struct holds statistics related to received packets, such as the number of packets, packet batches, full packet batches, and the maximum channel length. The `report` method is used to log these statistics.

The `recv_loop` function is the core of the receiver service. It continuously receives packets from a UDP socket and sends them as a batch to the `PacketBatchSender`. It also updates the `StreamerReceiveStats` with the latest statistics.

The `receiver` function creates a new thread that runs the `recv_loop` function. It takes a UDP socket, an exit signal, a `PacketBatchSender`, a `PacketBatchRecycler`, and other parameters as input.

The `responder` function creates a new thread that runs the `recv_send` function. It takes a name, a UDP socket, a `PacketBatchReceiver`, a `SocketAddrSpace`, and an optional `stats_reporter_sender` as input. The `recv_send` function receives packet batches from the `PacketBatchReceiver`, filters them based on the `SocketAddrSpace`, and sends them using the provided UDP socket.

The `recv_packet_batches` and `recv_vec_packet_batches` functions are utility functions that receive packet batches from a `PacketBatchReceiver` and return them as a tuple containing the received packet batches, the total number of packets, and the duration of the receive operation.

In summary, the `streamer` module provides efficient and high-throughput data streaming services for the Solana proj
