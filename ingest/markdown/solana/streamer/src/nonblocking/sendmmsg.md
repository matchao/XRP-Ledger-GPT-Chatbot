The `sendmmsg` module provides a nonblocking implementation of the `sendmmsg()` API for sending multiple UDP packets in a single call. This module is part of the Solana project and is used to improve the efficiency of sending multiple packets over the network.

The main functions provided by this module are `batch_send()` and `multi_target_send()`. 

`batch_send()` takes a reference to a `UdpSocket`, and a slice of tuples containing packet data and socket addresses. It sends each packet to its corresponding address using the provided socket. The function returns a `Result` indicating success or an error with the number of failed sends. This function is useful when you need to send different packets to different addresses.

```rust
let sent = batch_send(&sender, &packet_refs[..]).await.ok();
assert_eq!(sent, Some(()));
```

`multi_target_send()` takes a reference to a `UdpSocket`, a single packet, and a slice of socket addresses. It sends the same packet to all the provided addresses using the provided socket. The function returns a `Result` indicating success or an error with the number of failed sends. This function is useful when you need to send the same packet to multiple addresses.

```rust
let sent = multi_target_send(
    &sender,
    packet.data(..).unwrap(),
    &[&addr, &addr2, &addr3, &addr4],
)
.await
.ok();
assert_eq!(sent, Some(()));
```

The module also includes tests to ensure the correct functionality of the provided functions. These tests cover various scenarios, such as sending packets to a single destination, multiple destinations, and handling intermediate failures due to unreachable addresses or mismatched bindings.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `batch_send` function and how does it handle errors?
   **Answer**: The `batch_send` function is used to send multiple packets to their respective destinations in a non-blocking manner using the `sendmmsg()` API. It handles errors by counting the number of failed sends and storing the first encountered error. If there is any error, it returns a `SendPktsError::IoError` with the first error and the number of failed sends.

2. **Question**: How does the `multi_target_send` function work and when should it be used?
   **Answer**: The `multi_target_send` function is used to send a single packet to multiple destinations. It creates a vector of packet references and destination addresses, and then calls the `batch_send` function to send the packet to all the specified destinations. This function is useful when you need to send the same data to multiple recipients.

3. **Question**: What are the test cases in the `tests` module testing for, and how do they ensure the correctness of the implementation?
   **Answer**: The test cases in the `tests` module are testing various scenarios for the `batch_send` and `multi_target_send` functions, such as sending packets to a single destination, multiple destinations, handling intermediate failures, and unreachable addresses. They ensure the correctness of the implementation by checking the expected results, such as the number of packets sent, received, and failed, as well as the specific error types encountered in case of failures.
