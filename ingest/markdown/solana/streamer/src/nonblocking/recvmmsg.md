The `recvmmsg` module provides a nonblocking `recvmmsg()` API implementation. The purpose of this module is to read packets from a UDP socket into a specified container. The module contains two functions: `recv_mmsg()` and `recv_mmsg_exact()`. 

The `recv_mmsg()` function pulls some packets from the socket into the specified container and returns how many packets were read. The function takes a reference to a `UdpSocket` and a mutable reference to a slice of `Packet` structs. The function first checks that all packets in the slice have a default `Meta` value. It then sets the number of packets to read as the minimum between the number of packets in the slice and the constant `NUM_RCVMMSGS`. The function then waits for the socket to be readable. It then iterates over the packets in the slice, setting the size of the packet's `Meta` to 0 and attempting to receive a packet from the socket. If the receive operation returns an error with a kind of `WouldBlock`, the function breaks out of the loop. If the receive operation returns an error of any other kind, the function returns the error. If the receive operation is successful, the function sets the size of the packet's `Meta` to the number of bytes received and sets the socket address of the packet's `Meta` to the address of the sender. The function returns the number of packets read.

The `recv_mmsg_exact()` function reads the exact number of packets required to fill the slice of packets. The function takes a reference to a `UdpSocket` and a mutable reference to a slice of `Packet` structs. The function first sets the total number of packets to read as the length of the slice. It then enters a loop that continues until all packets have been read. In each iteration of the loop, the function calls `recv_mmsg()` with a slice of packets starting at the index of the first packet that has not yet been read and ending at the end of the slice. The function subtracts the number of packets read from the total number of packets and continues the loop until all packets have been read. The function returns the length of the slice.

The `recvmmsg` module is used in the larger Solana project to receive packets from UDP sockets in a nonblocking manner. The module provides an efficient way to read multiple packets from a socket at once, reducing the number of system calls required to read packets. The module is used in various places throughout the Solana codebase, including in the networking stack and in the validator. 

Example usage:

```rust
use solana::streamer::recvmmsg::{recv_mmsg, recv_mmsg_exact};
use solana::streamer::packet::Packet;
use tokio::net::UdpSocket;

async fn read_packets(socket: &UdpSocket, num_packets: usize) -> Vec<Packet> {
    let mut packets = vec![Packet::default(); num_packets];
    let num_read = recv_mmsg_exact(socket, &mut packets[..]).await.unwrap();
    packets.truncate(num_read);
    packets
}

async fn read_packets_nonblocking(socket: &UdpSocket, num_packets: usize) -> Vec<Packet> {
    let mut packets = vec![Packet::default(); num_packets];
    let num_read = recv_mmsg(socket, &mut packets[..]).await.unwrap();
    packets.truncate(num_read);
    packets
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this module?
    
    This module provides a nonblocking recvmmsg() API implementation.

2. What does the `recv_mmsg` function do?
    
    The `recv_mmsg` function pulls some packets from the socket into the specified container and returns how many packets were read.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_multi_iter` function?
    
    The `test_multi_iter` function tests the `recv_mmsg_exact` function by sending multiple packets to the socket and ensuring that the correct number of packets are received and that their metadata is correct.
