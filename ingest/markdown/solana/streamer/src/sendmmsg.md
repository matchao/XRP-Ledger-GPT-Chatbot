The `sendmmsg.rs` module provides an implementation of the `sendmmsg()` API for sending multiple UDP packets in a single system call. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of making multiple system calls for each packet.

The module defines a `SendPktsError` enum to handle errors that may occur during the sending process. It also provides a `batch_send()` function, which takes a reference to a `UdpSocket` and a slice of packets to be sent. The function sends the packets to their respective destinations and returns a `Result` indicating success or the number of failed packets.

For Linux systems, the module provides a specialized implementation of `batch_send()` using the `sendmmsg()` system call. It sets up the necessary data structures, such as `iovec`, `sockaddr_storage`, and `mmsghdr`, and calls `sendmmsg()` to send the packets. If any packets fail to send, the function retries sending them and captures the error code.

For non-Linux systems, the module provides a fallback implementation of `batch_send()` that iterates over the packets and sends them one by one using the `send_to()` method of `UdpSocket`. If any packets fail to send, the function captures the first error and the number of failed packets.

Additionally, the module provides a `multi_target_send()` function that sends a single packet to multiple destinations. This function takes a reference to a `UdpSocket`, a packet, and a slice of destination addresses. It creates a vector of packet references and destination addresses, and then calls `batch_send()` to send the packets.

The module also includes tests to ensure the correct functionality of the implemented functions, such as sending packets to multiple destinations, handling intermediate failures, and sending packets to unreachable addresses.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `sendmmsg` module and how does it differ from the standard `sendmsg` function?
   
   **Answer:** The `sendmmsg` module provides an implementation of the `sendmmsg()` API, which allows sending multiple messages in a single system call. This can improve performance by reducing the number of system calls compared to using the standard `sendmsg` function for each message.

2. **Question:** How does the `batch_send` function handle different target operating systems?

   **Answer:** The `batch_send` function has separate implementations for Linux and non-Linux target operating systems. For Linux, it uses the `sendmmsg` system call to send multiple messages at once, while for non-Linux systems, it falls back to a loop that sends each message individually using the `send_to` method.

3. **Question:** How does the `multi_target_send` function work, and what is its use case?

   **Answer:** The `multi_target_send` function sends a single packet to multiple destinations. It takes a UDP socket, a packet, and a list of destination addresses as input. The function creates a vector of packet references, where each packet reference is paired with a destination address, and then calls the `batch_send` function to send the packets. This can be useful in scenarios where the same data needs to be sent to multiple recipients, such as broadcasting or multicasting.
