The `recvmmsg.rs` module provides an implementation of the `recv_mmsg()` function, which is used to receive multiple UDP packets from a socket in a single system call. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of making multiple system calls for each packet.

The implementation is platform-dependent, with separate implementations for Linux and non-Linux systems. On Linux, the `libc::recvmmsg()` function is used, which is a native Linux system call for receiving multiple messages. On non-Linux systems, the `recv_mmsg()` function falls back to a loop that calls `UdpSocket::recv_from()` for each packet.

The main function, `recv_mmsg()`, takes a reference to a `UdpSocket` and a mutable reference to a slice of `Packet` structs. It returns a `Result` containing the number of packets received. The function first checks if there are any leftover packets in the input slice and then proceeds to receive packets from the socket. On successful reception, it updates the metadata of each packet with the received size and the sender's socket address.

Here's an example of how the `recv_mmsg()` function can be used:

```rust
let socket = UdpSocket::bind("127.0.0.1:0").unwrap();
let mut packets = vec![Packet::default(); NUM_RCVMMSGS];
let num_received = recv_mmsg(&socket, &mut packets).unwrap();
```

The module also includes tests to ensure the correct functionality of the `recv_mmsg()` function, such as receiving packets from multiple senders, handling timeouts, and receiving packets in multiple iterations.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `recv_mmsg` function and how does it differ between Linux and non-Linux systems?

   **Answer:** The `recv_mmsg` function is used to receive multiple messages from a UDP socket in a single call. The implementation differs between Linux and non-Linux systems because the Linux version uses the `recvmmsg` system call, which is specific to Linux, while the non-Linux version uses a loop with `recv_from` to achieve a similar result.

2. **Question:** What is the role of the `cast_socket_addr` function in the Linux implementation of `recv_mmsg`?

   **Answer:** The `cast_socket_addr` function is used to convert a `sockaddr_storage` structure to an `InetAddr` (either IPv4 or IPv6) based on the address family and message name length. It is used in the Linux implementation of `recv_mmsg` to set the socket address in the packet metadata.

3. **Question:** How does the test `test_recv_mmsg_multi_iter` work, and what is it testing?

   **Answer:** The `test_recv_mmsg_multi_iter` test sets up a reader and sender UDP socket, sends a number of messages greater than `TEST_NUM_MSGS` from the sender to the reader, and then calls `recv_mmsg` twice to receive all the messages. The test checks that the received messages have the correct size and socket address, ensuring that `recv_mmsg` can handle receiving messages in multiple iterations.
