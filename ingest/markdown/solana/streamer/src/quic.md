The `quic.rs` file is responsible for setting up and managing a QUIC server in the Solana project. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a transport layer protocol that provides improved performance compared to traditional TCP, especially in high-latency environments.

The `configure_server` function sets up the server configuration, including creating a self-signed TLS certificate for secure communication. It also sets various QUIC-specific settings, such as the maximum number of concurrent unidirectional streams, stream receive window size, and idle timeout.

The `StreamStats` struct is used to collect various statistics related to the QUIC server, such as the number of active connections, new connections, evictions, and various error counts. The `report` method of `StreamStats` is used to log these statistics as datapoints.

The `spawn_server` function is responsible for starting the QUIC server with the given configuration. It takes several parameters, such as the UDP socket to bind to, the keypair for the TLS certificate, the maximum number of connections per peer, and the maximum number of staked and unstaked connections. It also takes a `Sender<PacketBatch>` for sending received packets to the appropriate consumer. The function returns a tuple containing the `Endpoint` and a `JoinHandle` for the spawned server thread.

The server is implemented using the `tokio` runtime for asynchronous I/O and the `quinn` crate for the QUIC protocol implementation. The server listens for incoming connections and streams, processes the received data, and sends it to the appropriate consumer.

The test module contains various tests for the QUIC server, such as checking server exit, handling multiple connections, handling multiple streams, and handling multiple writes. These tests help ensure the correct functioning of the server and its various components.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SkipClientVerification` struct and its implementation of the `rustls::server::ClientCertVerifier` trait?
   
   **Answer:** The `SkipClientVerification` struct is used to create a custom client certificate verifier that does not perform any actual verification of client certificates. This is done by implementing the `rustls::server::ClientCertVerifier` trait and returning an empty `DistinguishedNames` list in the `client_auth_root_subjects` method and always returning `Ok` in the `verify_client_cert` method.

2. **Question:** What are the constants `MAX_STAKED_CONNECTIONS` and `MAX_UNSTAKED_CONNECTIONS` used for in the code?

   **Answer:** `MAX_STAKED_CONNECTIONS` and `MAX_UNSTAKED_CONNECTIONS` are constants that define the maximum number of allowed connections for staked and unstaked nodes, respectively. These values are used to limit the number of concurrent connections the server can handle from staked and unstaked nodes.

3. **Question:** How does the `StreamStats` struct work and what is its purpose in the code?

   **Answer:** The `StreamStats` struct is used to store various statistics related to the QUIC server, such as the number of active connections, active streams, new connections, new streams, and other metrics. It provides a `report` method that logs these statistics as datapoints, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging the server's performance.
