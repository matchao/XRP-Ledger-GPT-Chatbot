The `cluster_tpu_info.rs` file contains the implementation of the `ClusterTpuInfo` struct and its associated methods. This struct is used to provide information about the TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) cluster to other parts of the Solana project. 

The `ClusterTpuInfo` struct contains three fields: `cluster_info`, `poh_recorder`, and `recent_peers`. `cluster_info` is an instance of the `ClusterInfo` struct from the `solana_gossip` crate, which provides information about the nodes in the cluster. `poh_recorder` is an instance of the `PohRecorder` struct from the `solana_poh` crate, which records Proof of History (PoH) entries. `recent_peers` is a `HashMap` that maps `Pubkey` values to `SocketAddr` values, representing the most recent peers that have been seen by the cluster.

The `ClusterTpuInfo` struct implements the `TpuInfo` trait, which defines two methods: `refresh_recent_peers` and `get_leader_tpus`. The `refresh_recent_peers` method updates the `recent_peers` field with the most recent peers seen by the cluster. The `get_leader_tpus` method returns a vector of `SocketAddr` values representing the leader TPUs (Transaction Processing Units) for the current slot and the next `max_count` slots.

The `test` module contains a test for the `get_leader_tpus` method. This test creates a new `ClusterTpuInfo` instance and checks that the `get_leader_tpus` method returns the correct leader TPUs for the current slot and the next `max_count` slots.

Overall, the `ClusterTpuInfo` struct and its associated methods provide a way for other parts of the Solana project to obtain information about the TPU cluster, including the most recent peers and the leader TPUs for the current and future slots. This information is used to coordinate the processing of transactions and other operations within the cluster.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ClusterTpuInfo` struct?
- The `ClusterTpuInfo` struct is used to store information about the cluster's TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) nodes, including the `ClusterInfo` and `PohRecorder` instances, as well as a mapping of recent peers.

2. What is the `refresh_recent_peers` function used for?
- The `refresh_recent_peers` function updates the `recent_peers` mapping of the `ClusterTpuInfo` struct with the latest information about the TPU peers from the `ClusterInfo` instance.

3. What is the purpose of the `test_get_leader_tpus` function?
- The `test_get_leader_tpus` function is a unit test that verifies the correctness of the `get_leader_tpus` function of the `ClusterTpuInfo` struct, which returns a list of unique socket addresses for the current and future leaders of the cluster based on the `PohRecorder` instance and the `recent_peers` mapping.
