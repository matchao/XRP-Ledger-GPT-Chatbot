The `TransactionStatusService` is responsible for processing transaction status updates and storing them in the blockstore. It is used in the Solana project to maintain transaction history and notify external components about transaction status changes.

The `TransactionStatusService` struct contains a single field, `thread_hdl`, which is a handle to the spawned thread that runs the service. The `new` function is used to create a new instance of the `TransactionStatusService`. It takes several arguments, including a `Receiver<TransactionStatusMessage>`, an `Arc<AtomicU64>` for the maximum complete transaction status slot, a boolean flag to enable or disable RPC transaction history, an optional `TransactionNotifierLock`, a reference to the `Blockstore`, and an `Arc<AtomicBool>` for the exit signal.

The main loop of the service is implemented in the `spawn` closure within the `new` function. It continuously checks for the exit signal and processes incoming `TransactionStatusMessage`s by calling the `write_transaction_status_batch` function. This function processes the transaction status messages and writes the transaction status metadata to the blockstore. If the `enable_rpc_transaction_history` flag is set, it also writes transaction memos and transaction status to the blockstore.

The `TransactionStatusService` also provides a `join` function, which allows waiting for the spawned thread to finish its execution.

In the tests module, the `TestTransactionNotifier` struct is used to test the transaction notification functionality. It implements the `TransactionNotifier` trait and stores received notifications in a `DashMap`. The `test_notify_transaction` function demonstrates how to use the `TransactionStatusService` and `TestTransactionNotifier` to process and notify transaction status updates.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TransactionStatusService` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `TransactionStatusService` struct is responsible for managing the transaction status writing thread. It provides methods to create a new instance of the service, write transaction status batches, and join the thread when the service is stopped.

2. **Question**: How does the `write_transaction_status_batch` function work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `write_transaction_status_batch` function processes a batch of transaction status messages and writes them to the blockstore. It takes several inputs such as the transaction status receiver, max complete transaction status slot, enable_rpc_transaction_history flag, transaction notifier, blockstore, and enable_extended_tx_metadata_storage flag. It returns a `Result<(), RecvTimeoutError>` indicating the success or failure of the operation.

3. **Question**: What is the role of the `TransactionNotifier` trait and how is it used in the `TransactionStatusService`?
   **Answer**: The `TransactionNotifier` trait defines an interface for notifying external components about transaction status updates. It is used in the `TransactionStatusService` to send notifications about transaction status changes to any registered notifiers, allowing external components to react to these changes.
