The `optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker` module provides a threaded service to track the most recent optimistically confirmed bank for use in RPC services and triggers gossip subscription notifications. It maintains an `OptimisticallyConfirmedBank` struct that holds the most recent optimistically confirmed bank and provides methods to update and access it.

The `OptimisticallyConfirmedBankTracker` struct is responsible for managing the thread that listens for bank notifications and processes them accordingly. It is initialized with a `BankNotificationReceiver`, `exit` flag, `BankForks`, `OptimisticallyConfirmedBank`, `RpcSubscriptions`, and an optional list of `BankNotificationSender` subscribers.

The main functionality of the tracker is implemented in the `process_notification` method, which takes a `BankNotification` and updates the optimistically confirmed bank and pending banks accordingly. It also sends notifications to the RPC subscriptions and bank notification subscribers.

Here's an example of how the tracker is used:

```rust
let optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker = OptimisticallyConfirmedBankTracker::new(
    receiver,
    &exit,
    bank_forks,
    optimistically_confirmed_bank,
    subscriptions,
    bank_notification_subscribers,
);
```

The tracker processes three types of bank notifications:

1. `OptimisticallyConfirmed`: When a bank is optimistically confirmed, the tracker updates the optimistically confirmed bank if the new bank's slot is higher and the bank is frozen. It also sends notifications to RPC subscriptions and bank notification subscribers.

2. `Frozen`: When a bank is frozen, the tracker updates the optimistically confirmed bank if the frozen bank's slot is higher. It also sends notifications to RPC subscriptions and bank notification subscribers.

3. `Root`: When a new root bank is set, the tracker updates the optimistically confirmed bank if the new root bank's slot is higher. It also clears the pending banks that are less than or equal to the new root bank's slot.

The tracker can be closed by calling the `close` method, which joins the internal thread and returns the result.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `OptimisticallyConfirmedBankTracker` struct and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `OptimisticallyConfirmedBankTracker` struct is used to track the most recent optimistically confirmed bank for use in RPC services and trigger gossip subscription notifications. It maintains a separate thread that listens for bank notifications and processes them accordingly, updating the optimistically confirmed bank and notifying subscribers when necessary.

2. **Question**: How does the `OptimisticallyConfirmedBank` struct work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `OptimisticallyConfirmedBank` struct is a simple wrapper around an `Arc<Bank>` that represents the most recent optimistically confirmed bank. It provides a method `locked_from_bank_forks_root` to create a new instance of `OptimisticallyConfirmedBank` from the root bank of a given `BankForks`.

3. **Question**: How does the `BankNotification` enum work and what are its variants used for?
   **Answer**: The `BankNotification` enum is used to represent different types of notifications related to banks. It has three variants: `OptimisticallyConfirmed`, `Frozen`, and `Root`. These variants are used to notify the `OptimisticallyConfirmedBankTracker` about changes in the state of banks, such as when a bank is optimistically confirmed, frozen, or becomes the root bank.
