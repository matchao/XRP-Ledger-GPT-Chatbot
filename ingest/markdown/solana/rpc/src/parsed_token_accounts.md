The `parsed_token_accounts.rs` file in the Solana project contains functions for parsing token accounts and returning them in a user-friendly format. The `get_parsed_token_account` function takes a bank, a public key, and an account and returns a `UiAccount` struct that contains the parsed account data. The `get_parsed_token_accounts` function takes a bank and an iterator of keyed accounts and returns an iterator of `RpcKeyedAccount` structs, each containing a public key and the parsed account data.

The `get_mint_owner_and_decimals` function is a helper function that takes a bank and a mint public key and returns the owner of the mint account and the number of decimals associated with the mint. If the mint is the native mint, the function returns the program ID for the native mint and the number of decimals associated with it.

The `get_parsed_token_account` and `get_parsed_token_accounts` functions use the `get_token_account_mint` function from the `solana_account_decoder` crate to get the mint public key associated with the account. They then use the `get_mint_owner_and_decimals` function to get the owner and number of decimals associated with the mint. Finally, they use the `UiAccount::encode` function to encode the account data in a user-friendly format.

The `get_parsed_token_accounts` function also uses a `HashMap` to cache the number of decimals associated with each mint, in order to avoid unnecessary calls to `get_mint_owner_and_decimals`.

Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to parse token accounts and return them in a user-friendly format. They may be used in the larger Solana project to provide information about token accounts to users and developers. For example, they could be used in a wallet application to display the user's token balances.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides functions for getting parsed token accounts and analyzing a mint Pubkey to get the mint-account owner and decimals.

2. What dependencies are required for this code to function?
    
    This code requires dependencies from `jsonrpc_core`, `solana_account_decoder`, `solana_rpc_client_api`, `solana_runtime`, `solana_sdk`, and `spl_token_2022`.

3. What is the expected output of the `get_parsed_token_accounts` function?
    
    The `get_parsed_token_accounts` function returns an iterator of `RpcKeyedAccount` structs, each containing a string representation of the account's public key and its parsed data in JSON format.
