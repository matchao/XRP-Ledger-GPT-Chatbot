The `solana/banks-client/src/lib.rs` file provides a client for interacting with the ledger state from the perspective of an arbitrary validator. The main struct in this file is `BanksClient`, which provides methods for sending and processing transactions, querying account information, and interacting with the cluster.

To create a new `BanksClient`, use the `start_tcp_client()` function, which returns a `BanksClient` instance connected to the specified address. The `BanksClient` struct provides various methods for interacting with the ledger state, such as:

- `send_transaction()`: Sends a transaction and returns immediately. The server will resend the transaction until it is accepted by the cluster or the transaction's blockhash expires.
- `process_transaction()`: Sends a transaction and returns after the transaction has been rejected or reached the given level of commitment.
- `get_account()`: Returns the account at the given address at the time of the most recent root slot. If the account is not found, None is returned.
- `get_balance()`: Returns the balance in lamports of an account at the given address at the time of the most recent root slot.
- `get_transaction_status()`: Returns the status of a transaction with a signature matching the transaction's first signature. Returns None if the transaction is not found.

These methods can be used to interact with the ledger state, send and process transactions, and query account information. For example, to send a transaction and wait for it to be processed, you can use the following code:

```rust
let transaction = Transaction::new(...);
let mut banks_client = start_tcp_client(addr).await?;
banks_client.process_transaction(transaction).await?;
```

Additionally, the `BanksClient` struct provides methods with `_with_context` and `_with_commitment` suffixes, which allow for more fine-grained control over the context and commitment level used for the request. These methods are generally more cumbersome to use and may change over time, so they are not documented.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `BanksClient` struct and how does it interact with the `TarpcClient`?
   **Answer:** The `BanksClient` struct is a client for the ledger state from the perspective of an arbitrary validator. It wraps the `TarpcClient` and provides methods to interact with the ledger state, such as sending transactions, getting account information, and simulating transactions.

2. **Question:** How does the `start_tcp_client` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The `start_tcp_client` function is used to create a new `BanksClient` instance by connecting to a TCP server with the given address. It establishes a connection using the `tcp::connect` function and then creates a `BanksClient` with the connected transport.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `BanksClientExt` trait and why is it empty?
   **Answer:** The `BanksClientExt` trait exists only for backward compatibility. It is empty because it does not provide any additional functionality, but it might have been used in previous versions of the code to extend the functionality of the `BanksClient`.
