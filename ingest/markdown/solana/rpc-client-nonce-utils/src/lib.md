The `lib.rs` file in `rpc-client-nonce-utils` module provides durable transaction nonce helpers for the Solana blockchain. The module contains two sub-modules, `blockhash_query` and `nonblocking`, which provide utility functions for querying blockhashes and nonces respectively. 

The `get_account` and `get_account_with_commitment` functions are used to retrieve a nonce account from the network. Both functions take an instance of `RpcClient` and a `Pubkey` as input parameters. The `get_account` function returns an `Account` object if the account exists and passes all the checks from `account_identity_ok`. The `get_account_with_commitment` function is similar to `get_account`, but it also takes a `CommitmentConfig` object as an input parameter, which specifies the commitment level to use when querying the account. 

The `account_identity_ok` function is used to check if the nonce account is valid. It checks if the account is non-zero, has the correct owner, and has the correct data length. The `data_from_account`, `data_from_state`, and `state_from_account` functions are helper functions used by `account_identity_ok` to extract data from the account object. 

The `Error` enum is used to represent errors that can occur when retrieving a nonce account. The `Error` type is returned by both `get_account` and `get_account_with_commitment` if any of the checks from `account_identity_ok` fail. 

This module is used by other modules in the Solana project that require durable transaction nonces. For example, the `solana-sdk` module uses this module to retrieve a nonce account when creating a transaction. 

Example usage:

```rust
use solana_rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_sdk::{pubkey::Pubkey, commitment_config::CommitmentConfig};
use solana_rpc_client::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_sdk::account::Account;
use solana_sdk::signature::{Keypair, Signer};

let rpc_client = RpcClient::new("https://api.devnet.solana.com".to_string());
let nonce_account_keypair = Keypair::new();
let nonce_pubkey = nonce_account_keypair.pubkey();
let commitment_config = CommitmentConfig::default();

// Get the nonce account from the network
let nonce_account = get_account_with_commitment(&rpc_client, &nonce_pubkey, commitment_config).unwrap();

// Use the nonce account to create a transaction
let transaction = Transaction::new_with_nonce(
    &[from_keypair.pubkey(), to_pubkey],
    message,
    &nonce_pubkey,
    &from_keypair,
);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this module?
    
    This module provides durable transaction nonce helpers for the Solana blockchain.

2. What is the difference between `get_account` and `get_account_with_commitment` functions?
    
    `get_account` function gets a nonce account from the network with default commitment configuration, while `get_account_with_commitment` function gets a nonce account from the network with a specified commitment configuration.

3. What is the purpose of the `account_identity_ok` function?
    
    The `account_identity_ok` function checks if the given account is a valid nonce account by verifying its owner and data length.
