The `blockhash_query.rs` file is part of the Solana RPC client nonce utilities and is responsible for querying and validating blockhashes from either the cluster or a nonce account. It defines two enums, `Source` and `BlockhashQuery`, and their associated methods.

The `Source` enum has two variants: `Cluster` and `NonceAccount(Pubkey)`. It has two methods:

1. `get_blockhash`: This method takes an `RpcClient` and a `CommitmentConfig` as arguments and returns the blockhash depending on the source. If the source is `Cluster`, it fetches the latest blockhash from the cluster. If the source is `NonceAccount`, it fetches the blockhash from the nonce account.

```rust
pub async fn get_blockhash(
    &self,
    rpc_client: &RpcClient,
    commitment: CommitmentConfig,
) -> Result<Hash, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
```

2. `is_blockhash_valid`: This method takes an `RpcClient`, a reference to a `Hash`, and a `CommitmentConfig` as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the blockhash is valid or not. If the source is `Cluster`, it checks the validity of the blockhash using the `is_blockhash_valid` method of the `RpcClient`. If the source is `NonceAccount`, it checks the validity of the blockhash by fetching the nonce account data.

```rust
pub async fn is_blockhash_valid(
    &self,
    rpc_client: &RpcClient,
    blockhash: &Hash,
    commitment: CommitmentConfig,
) -> Result<bool, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
```

The `BlockhashQuery` enum has three variants: `Static(Hash)`, `Validated(Source, Hash)`, and `Rpc(Source)`. It has two methods:

1. `new`: This method takes an `Option<Hash>`, a boolean `sign_only`, and an `Option<Pubkey>` as arguments and returns a `BlockhashQuery` instance based on the input parameters.

```rust
pub fn new(blockhash: Option<Hash>, sign_only: bool, nonce_account: Option<Pubkey>) -> Self
```

2. `get_blockhash`: This method takes an `RpcClient` and a `CommitmentConfig` as arguments and returns the blockhash depending on the `BlockhashQuery` variant. If the variant is `Static`, it returns the static blockhash. If the variant is `Validated`, it checks the validity of the blockhash using the `is_blockhash_valid` method of the `Source` and returns the blockhash if it's valid. If the variant is `Rpc`, it fetches the blockhash from the source using the `get_blockhash` method of the `Source`.

```rust
pub async fn get_blockhash(
    &self,
    rpc_client: &RpcClient,
    commitment: CommitmentConfig,
) -> Result<Hash, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
```

These utilities can be used in the larger Solana project to fetch and validate blockhashes for various operations, such as transaction signing and nonce management.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Source` enum and its variants?
   **Answer:** The `Source` enum represents the source of the blockhash. It has two variants: `Cluster` and `NonceAccount(Pubkey)`. `Cluster` represents the blockhash coming from the cluster, while `NonceAccount(Pubkey)` represents the blockhash coming from a specific nonce account with the given public key.

2. **Question:** How does the `BlockhashQuery` enum work and what are its variants used for?
   **Answer:** The `BlockhashQuery` enum is used to represent different ways of querying a blockhash. It has three variants: `Static(Hash)`, `Validated(Source, Hash)`, and `Rpc(Source)`. `Static(Hash)` represents a static blockhash, `Validated(Source, Hash)` represents a blockhash that needs to be validated from the given source, and `Rpc(Source)` represents a blockhash that needs to be fetched from the given source using an RPC call.

3. **Question:** How does the `get_blockhash` method work for the `BlockhashQuery` enum?
   **Answer:** The `get_blockhash` method is an asynchronous method that takes an `RpcClient` and a `CommitmentConfig` as arguments. It returns a `Result<Hash, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`. Depending on the variant of the `BlockhashQuery` enum, it either returns the static blockhash, validates the blockhash from the given source, or fetches the blockhash from the given source using an RPC call.
